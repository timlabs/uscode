### §2732. Medal of honor
* The President may award, and present in the name of Congress, a medal of honor of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to an individual who, while a member of the Coast Guard, displays conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of such individual's life above and beyond the call of duty—

  * (1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;

### §2735. Coast Guard cross
* The President may award a Coast Guard cross of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to an individual who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating under the Department of the Navy, distinguishes himself or herself by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a medal of honor—

  * (1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;

  * (3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

### §2736. Distinguished service medal
* The President may present, but not in the name of Congress, a distinguished service medal of appropriate design, with accompanying ribbon, together with a rosette or other device, to be worn in lieu thereof, to any individual who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, performs exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility.

### §2737. Silver star medal
* The President may award a silver star medal of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to an individual who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating under the Department of the Navy, is cited for gallantry in action that does not warrant a medal of honor or Coast Guard cross—

  * (1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;

  * (2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force or international terrorist organization; or

  * (3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

### §2740. Insignia for additional awards
* No more than one Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or Coast Guard medal shall be issued to any one individual; but for each succeeding deed or service sufficient to justify the awarding of a Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or Coast Guard medal, the President may award a suitable emblem or insignia to be worn with the decoration and a corresponding rosette or other device.

### §2741. Time limit on award; report concerning deed
* (a) No medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof may be awarded to an individual unless—

  * (1) the award is made within five years after the date of the deed or service justifying the award;

  * (2) a statement setting forth the deed or distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made by his superior through official channels within three years from the date of that deed or termination of the service.


* (b) If the Secretary determines that—

  * (1) a statement setting forth the deed or distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made by the individual's superior through official channels within three years from the date of that deed or termination of the service and was supported by sufficient evidence within that time; and

  * (2) no award was made, because the statement was lost or through inadvertence the recommendation was not acted upon; a medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, as the case may be, may be awarded to the individual within two years after the date of that determination.

### §2742. Honorable subsequent service as condition to award
* No medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof shall be awarded or presented to any individual, or to the representative of any individual, whose entire service subsequent to the time of the acts resulting in the consideration of such award shall not in the opinion of the Commandant have been honorable.

### §2743. Posthumous awards
* In case an individual who dies before the making of any award to which such individual may be entitled, as authorized in this chapter, the award may be made and presented within five years from the date of the act or service justifying the award to such next of kin as may have been designated by the individual, or in the absence of such designation, or if the designated individual is not alive at the time of the award, or the relationship between such individual and the serviceman shall have been terminated before his death, then to such representative as the President designates. In the event of a posthumous award when the award will be made to the parents of the deceased and the parents have been divorced or separated, a duplicate award may be made to each parent.

### §2744. Life-saving medals
* (a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award a Life-saving medal of gold or silver to any individual, including personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other individual from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the water in accordance with the following provisions:

  * (1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;

  * (2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold, but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver.


* (b) In order for an individual to be eligible for the Life-saving Medals the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States.

* (c) No individual shall receive more than one gold medal and one silver medal; but any individual who has received or may hereafter receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded. Medals and bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this subsection, may be awarded posthumously.

### §2745. Replacement of medals
* In those cases where a medal, or a bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, awarded pursuant to this chapter has been stolen, lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use without fault or neglect on the part of the individual to whom it was awarded, such medal, or bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, shall be replaced without charge, or, in the discretion of the Secretary, upon condition that the Government is reimbursed for the cost thereof.
