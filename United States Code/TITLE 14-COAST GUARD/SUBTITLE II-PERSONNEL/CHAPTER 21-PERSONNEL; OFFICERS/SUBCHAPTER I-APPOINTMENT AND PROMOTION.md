The position of such a Reserve officer among other officers of the Coast Guard on active duty who have the same date of rank shall be determined by the Secretary.

### §2103. Number and distribution of commissioned officers on active duty promotion list
* (a) MAXIMUM TOTAL NUMBER.—The total number of Coast Guard commissioned officers on the active duty promotion list, excluding warrant officers, shall not exceed 6,900; except that the Commandant may temporarily increase that number by up to 2 percent for no more than 60 days following the date of the commissioning of a Coast Guard Academy class.

* (b) DISTRIBUTION PERCENTAGES BY GRADE.—

  * (1) REQUIRED.—The total number of commissioned officers authorized by this section shall be distributed in grade in the following percentages: 0.375 percent for rear admiral; 0.375 percent for rear admiral (lower half); 6.0 percent for captain; 15.0 percent for commander; and 22.0 percent for lieutenant commander.

* (d) USE OF NUMBERS; TEMPORARY INCREASES.—The numbers resulting from computations under subsection (c) shall be, for all purposes, the authorized number in each grade; except that the authorized number for a grade is temporarily increased during the period between one computation and the next by the number of officers originally appointed in that grade during that period and the number of officers of that grade for whom vacancies exist in the next higher grade but whose promotion has been delayed for any reason.

* (e) OFFICERS SERVING COAST GUARD ACADEMY AND RESERVE.—The number of officers authorized to be serving on active duty in each grade of the permanent commissioned teaching staff of the Coast Guard Academy and of the Reserve serving in connection with organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the reserve components shall be prescribed by the Secretary.

### §2104. Appointment of temporary officers
* (a) The president may appoint temporary commissioned officers—

  * (1) in the Regular Coast Guard in a grade, not above lieutenant, appropriate to their qualifications, experience, and length of service, as the needs of the Coast Guard may require, from among the commissioned warrant officers, warrant officers, and enlisted members of the Coast Guard, and from holders of licenses issued under chapter 71 of title 46; and

  * (2) in the Coast Guard Reserve in a grade, not above lieutenant, appropriate to their qualifications, experience, and length of service, as the needs of the Coast Guard may require, from among the commissioned warrant officers of the Coast Guard Reserve.


* (b) Temporary appointments under this section do not change the permanent, probationary, or acting status of individuals so appointed, prejudice them in regard to promotion or appointment, or abridge their rights or benefits. An individual who is appointed under this section may not suffer any reduction in the rate of pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled had he remained in his former grade and continued to receive the increases in pay and allowances authorized for that grade.

* (c) An appointment under this section, or a subsequent promotion appointment of a temporary officer, may be vacated by the appointing officer at any time. Each officer whose appointment is so vacated shall revert to his permanent status.

* At least once a year and at such other times as the needs of the service require, the Secretary shall convene selection boards to recommend for promotion to the next higher grade officers on the active duty promotion list in each grade from lieutenant (junior grade) through captain, with separate boards for each grade. However, the Secretary is not required to convene a board to recommend officers for promotion to a grade when no vacancies exist in the grade concerned, and he estimates that none will occur in the next twelve months.

### §2107. Selection boards; composition of boards
* A board convened under section 2106 of this title shall consist of five or more officers on the active duty promotion list who are serving in or above the grade to which the board may recommend officers for promotion. No officer may be a member of two successive boards convened to consider officers of the same grade for promotion.

### §2108. Selection boards; notice of convening; communication with board
* (a) Before a board is convened under section 2106 of this title, notice of the convening date, the promotion zone to be considered, and the officers eligible for consideration shall be given to the service at large.

* (b) Each officer eligible for consideration by a selection board convened under section 2106 of this title may send a communication through official channels to the board, to arrive not later than the date the board convenes, inviting attention to any matter of record in the armed forces concerning such officer. A communication sent under this section may not criticize any officer or reflect upon the character, conduct, or motive of any officer.

### §2109. Selection boards; oath of members
* Each member of a selection board shall swear—

  * (1) that the member will, without prejudice or partiality, and having in view both the special fitness of officers and the efficiency of the Coast Guard, perform the duties imposed upon the member; and

  * (2) an oath in accordance with section 931.

### §2110. Number of officers to be selected for promotion
* Before convening a board under section 2106 of this title to recommend officers for promotion to any grade, the Secretary shall determine the total number of officers to be selected for promotion to that grade. This number shall be equal to the number of vacancies existing in the grade, plus the number of additional vacancies estimated for the next twelve months, less the number of officers on the selection list for the grade.

### §2111. Promotion zones
* (a) Before convening a selection board to recommend officers for promotion to any grade above lieutenant (junior grade) and below rear admiral (lower half), the Secretary shall establish a promotion zone for the grade to be considered. The promotion zone for each grade shall consist of the most senior officers of that grade on the active duty promotion list who are eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade and who have not previously been placed in a promotion zone for selection for promotion to the next higher grade. The number of officers in each zone shall be determined after considering—

  * (1) the needs of the service;

  * (2) the estimated numbers of vacancies available in future years to provide comparable opportunity for promotion of officers in successive year groups; and

  * (3) the extent to which current terms of service in that grade conform to a desirable career promotion pattern.


* However, such number of officers shall not exceed the number to be selected for promotion divided by one-half.

* (b) Promotion zones from which officers will be selected for promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be established by the Secretary as the needs of the service require.

### §2112. Promotion year; defined

### §2113. Eligibility of officers for consideration for promotion

  * (1) two years in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade);

  * (2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;

  * (3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;

  * (4) four years in the grade of commander; and

  * (5) three years in the grade of captain.


* (b) For the purpose of this section, service in a grade includes all qualifying service in that grade or a higher grade, under either a temporary or permanent appointment. However, service in a grade under a temporary service appointment under section 2125 of this title is considered as service only in the grade that the officer concerned would have held had he not been so appointed.

* (c) No officer may become eligible for consideration for promotion until all officers of his grade senior to him are so eligible.

* (d) Except when his name is on a list of selectees, each officer who becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade remains eligible so long as he—

  * (1) continues on active duty; and

  * (2) is not promoted to that grade.


* (e) An officer whose involuntary retirement or separation is deferred under section 2156 of this title is not eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade during the period of that deferment.

* (f) The Secretary may waive subsection (a) to the extent necessary to allow officers described therein to have at least two opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as officers below the promotion zone.

* (g)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Commandant may provide that an officer may, upon the officer's request and with the approval of the Commandant, be excluded from consideration by a selection board convened under section 2106.

* (2) The Commandant shall approve a request under paragraph (1) only if—

  * (A) the basis for the request is to allow the officer to complete a broadening assignment, advanced education, another assignment of significant value to the Coast Guard, a career progression requirement delayed by the assignment or education, or a qualifying personal or professional circumstance, as determined by the Commandant;

  * (B) the Commandant determines the exclusion from consideration is in the best interest of the Coast Guard; and

  * (C) the officer has not previously failed of selection for promotion to the grade for which the officer requests the exclusion from consideration.

### §2120. Special selection boards; correction of errors
* (a) OFFICERS NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR.—

  * (2) EFFECT.—An officer or former officer who is promoted to the next higher grade as a result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall have, upon such promotion, the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the active duty promotion list as the officer or former officer would have had if the officer or former officer had been recommended for promotion to that grade by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.
