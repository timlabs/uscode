### §2309. Recall to active duty with consent of member

### §2312. Extension of enlistments
* Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the term of enlistment of any enlisted member may, by voluntary written agreement, be extended and re-extended for a period not exceeding six full years from the date of expiration of the then-existing term of enlistment, and subsequent to such date an enlisted member who so extends his term of enlistment shall receive the same pay and allowances in all respects as though regularly discharged and reenlisted immediately upon expiration of his term of enlistment. However, the total of all such extensions of an enlistment may not exceed six years. No such extension shall operate to deprive the enlisted member concerned, upon discharge at the termination thereof, of any right, privilege, or benefit to which he would have been entitled if his term of enlistment had not been so extended.

### §2313. Retention beyond term of enlistment in case of disability
* Any enlisted member of the Coast Guard in the active service whose term of enlistment expires while he is suffering disease or injury incident to service and not due to misconduct, and who is in need of medical care or hospitalization, may, with his consent, be retained in such service beyond the expiration of his term of enlistment. Any such enlisted member shall be entitled to receive at Government expense medical care or hospitalization and his pay and allowances, including credit for longevity, until he shall have recovered to such extent as would enable him to meet the physical requirements for reenlistment, or until it shall have been ascertained by competent authority of the Coast Guard that the disease or injury is of a character that recovery to such an extent would be impossible. Any enlisted member whose enlistment is so extended shall be subject to forfeitures in the same manner and to the same extent as if his term of enlistment had not expired. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any enlisted member from being held in the service without his consent under section 2314 of this title.

### §2314. Detention beyond term of enlistment
* Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an enlisted member may be detained in the Coast Guard beyond the term of his enlistment:

  * (1) until the first arrival of the vessel on which he is serving at its permanent station, or at a port in a State of the United States or in the District of Columbia; or

  * (2) if attached to a shore station beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska, until his first arrival at a port in any State of the United States or in the District of Columbia where his reenlistment or discharge may be effected, or until he can be discharged or reenlisted at his station beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska, whichever is earlier, but in no event to exceed three months; or

  * (3) during a period of war or national emergency as proclaimed by the President, and, in the interest of national defense, for a period not to exceed six months after the end of the war or the termination of the emergency; or

  * (4) for a period of not exceeding thirty days in other cases whether or not specifically covered by this section, when essential to the public interests, and the determination that such detention is essential to the public interests, made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive.


* Any member detained in the Coast Guard as provided in this section shall be entitled to receive pay and allowances and benefits under the same conditions as though his enlistment period had not expired, and shall be subject in all respects to the laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard until his discharge therefrom. Enlisted members detained under the provisions of clause (1) shall be entitled to the pay and allowances provided for enlisted personnel of the Navy detained under similar circumstances.

### §2317. Aviation cadets; procurement; transfer
* (a) The grade of aviation cadet is established as a special enlisted grade in the Coast Guard. Under such regulations as the Secretary prescribes, citizens in civil life may be enlisted as, and enlisted members of the Coast Guard with their consent may be designated as, aviation cadets.

* (b) Except in time of war or national emergency declared by Congress, not less than 20 percent of the aviation cadets procured in each fiscal year shall be procured from qualified enlisted members of the Coast Guard.

* (c) No individuals may be enlisted or designated as an aviation cadet unless—

  * (1) the individual agrees in writing that, upon successful completion of the course of training as an aviation cadet, the individual will accept a commission as an ensign in the Coast Guard Reserve and will serve on active duty as such for at least three years, unless sooner released; and

  * (2) if under twenty-one years of age, the individual has the consent of the individual's parent or guardian to the agreement.


* (d) Under such regulations as the Secretary prescribes, an aviation cadet may be transferred to another enlisted grade or rating in the Coast Guard, released from active duty, or discharged.

### §2318. Aviation cadets; benefits
* Except as provided in section 402(c) of title 37, aviation cadets or their beneficiaries are entitled to the same allowances, pensions, gratuities, and other benefits as are provided for enlisted members in pay grade E–4. While on active duty, an aviation cadet is entitled to uniforms, clothing, and equipment at the expense of the United States.

### §2319. Critical skill training bonus
* (a) The Secretary may provide a bonus, not to exceed $20,000, to an enlisted member who completes training in a skill designated as critical, if at least four years of obligated active service remain on the member's enlistment at the time the training is completed. A bonus under this section may be paid in a single lump sum or in periodic installments.

* (b) If an enlisted member voluntarily or because of misconduct does not complete the member's term of obligated active service, the Secretary may require the member to repay the United States, on a pro rata basis, all sums paid under this section. The Secretary may charge interest on the amount repaid at a rate, to be determined quarterly, equal to 150 percent of the average of the yields on the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned during the calendar quarter preceding the date on which the amount to be repaid is determined.
