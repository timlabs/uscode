### SUBCHAPTER II—CADETS

### §1921. Corps of Cadets authorized strength
* The number of cadets appointed annually to the Academy shall be as determined by the Secretary but the number appointed in any one year shall not exceed six hundred.

### §1922. Appointments
* Appointments to cadetships shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who shall determine age limits, methods of selection of applicants, term of service as a cadet before graduation, and all other matters affecting such appointments. In the administration of this section, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to insure that female individuals shall be eligible for appointment and admission to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the relevant standards required for appointment, admission, training, graduation, and commissioning of female individuals shall be the same as those required for male individuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of physiological differences between male and female individuals.

### §1923. Admission of foreign nationals for instruction; restrictions; conditions
* (a) A foreign national may not receive instruction at the Academy except as authorized by this section.

* (b) The President may designate not more than 36 foreign nationals whom the Secretary may permit to receive instruction at the Academy.

* (c) A foreign national receiving instruction under this section is entitled to the same pay, allowances, and emoluments, to be paid from the same appropriations, as a cadet appointed pursuant to section 1922 of this title. A foreign national may receive instruction under this section only if his country agrees in advance to reimburse the United States, at a rate determined by the Secretary, for the cost of providing such instruction, including pay, allowances, and emoluments, unless a waiver therefrom has been granted to that country by the Secretary. Funds received by the Secretary for this purpose shall be credited to the appropriations bearing the cost thereof, and may be apportioned between fiscal years.

* (d) A foreign national receiving instruction under this section is—

  * (1) not entitled to any appointment in the Coast Guard by reason of his graduation from the Academy; and

  * (2) subject to those regulations applicable to the Academy governing admission, attendance, discipline, resignation, discharge, dismissal, and graduation, except as may otherwise be prescribed by the Secretary.

### §1924. Conduct
* The Secretary may summarily dismiss from the Coast Guard any cadet who, during his cadetship, is found unsatisfactory in either studies or conduct, or may be deemed not adapted for a career in the Coast Guard. Cadets shall be subject to rules governing discipline prescribed by the Commandant.

### §1925. Agreement
* (a) Each cadet shall sign an agreement with respect to the cadet's length of service in the Coast Guard. The agreement shall provide that the cadet agrees to the following:

  * (1) That the cadet will complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy.

  * (2) That upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy the cadet—

    * (A) will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a commissioned officer of the Coast Guard; and

    * (B) will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment.


  * (3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not tendered or if the cadet is permitted to resign as a regular officer before the completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet, the cadet—

    * (A) will accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve; and

    * (B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.


* (b)(1) The Secretary may transfer to the Coast Guard Reserve, and may order to active duty for such period of time as the Secretary prescribes (but not to exceed four years), a cadet who breaches an agreement under subsection (a). The period of time for which a cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10.

* (2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade or rating, as determined by the Secretary.

* (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a cadet shall be considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (a) if the cadet is separated from the Coast Guard Academy under circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by the cadet of the cadet's agreement to complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.

* (c) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Those regulations shall include—

  * (1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose of subsection (b), a breach of an agreement under subsection (a);

  * (2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has occurred; and

  * (3) standards for determining the period of time for which a person may be ordered to serve on active duty under subsection (b).


* (d) In this section, "commissioned service obligation", with respect to an officer who is a graduate of the Academy, means the period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.

* (e)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

* (2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or a guardian, the cadet may sign the agreement required by subsection (a) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.

* (f) A cadet or former cadet who does not fulfill the terms of the obligation to serve as specified under section (a), or the alternative obligation imposed under subsection (b), shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of title 37.

### §1926. Cadet applicants; preappointment travel to Academy
* The Secretary is authorized to expend appropriated funds for selective preappointment travel to the Academy for orientation visits of cadet applicants.

### §1927. Cadets; initial clothing allowance
* The Secretary may prescribe a sum which shall be credited to each new cadet upon first admission to the Academy, to cover the cost of an initial clothing and equipment issue, which sum shall be deducted subsequently from the pay of such cadet. Each cadet discharged prior to graduation who is indebted to the United States on account of advances of pay to purchase required clothing and equipment shall be required to turn in to the Academy all clothing and equipment of a distinctively military nature to the extent required to discharge such indebtedness; and, if the value of such clothing and equipment so turned in does not cover the indebtedness incurred, then such indebtedness shall be canceled.

### §1928. Cadets; degree of bachelor of science
* The Superintendent of the Academy may, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, confer the degree of bachelor of science upon all graduates of the Academy and may, in addition, confer the degree of bachelor of science upon such other living graduates of the Academy as shall have met the requirements of the Academy for such degree.

### §1929. Cadets; appointment as ensign
* The President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint as ensigns in the Coast Guard all cadets who shall graduate from the Academy. Ensigns so commissioned on the same date shall take rank according to their proficiency as shown by the order of their merit at date of graduation.

### §1930. Cadets: charges and fees for attendance; limitation
* (a) PROHIBITION.—Except as provided in subsection (b), no charge or fee for tuition, room, or board for attendance at the Academy may be imposed unless the charge or fee is specifically authorized by a law enacted after October 5, 1994.

* (b) EXCEPTION.—The prohibition specified in subsection (a) does not apply with respect to any item or service provided to cadets for which a charge or fee is imposed as of October 5, 1994. The Secretary shall notify Congress of any change made by the Academy in the amount of a charge or fee authorized under this subsection.
