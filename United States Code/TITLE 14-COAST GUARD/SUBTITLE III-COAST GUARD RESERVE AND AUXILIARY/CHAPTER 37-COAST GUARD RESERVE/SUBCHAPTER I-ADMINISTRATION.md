### SUBCHAPTER I—ADMINISTRATION

### §3701. Organization
* The Coast Guard Reserve is a component of the Coast Guard. It shall be organized, administered, trained, and supplied under the direction of the Commandant.

### §3702. Authorized strength
* (a) The President shall prescribe the authorized strength of the Coast Guard Reserve if not otherwise prescribed by law.

* (b) Subject to the authorized strength of the Coast Guard Reserve, the Secretary shall determine, at least annually, the authorized strength in numbers in each grade necessary to provide for mobilization requirements. Without the consent of the member concerned, a member of the Reserve may not be reduced in grade because of the Secretary's determination.

### §3703. Coast Guard Reserve Boards
* (a) The Secretary shall convene a Coast Guard Reserve Policy Board at least annually to consider, recommend, and report to the Secretary on Reserve policy matters. At least one-half of the members of the Board shall be Reserve officers.

* (b) The Secretary may convene any other Reserve Board the Secretary considers necessary.

### §3704. Grades and ratings; military authority
* The grades and ratings in the Reserve, including cadets but not grades above rear admiral, are those prescribed by law or regulation for the Coast Guard. A member of the Reserve on active duty or inactive-duty training has the same authority, rights, and privileges in the performance of that duty as a member of the Regular Coast Guard of corresponding grade or rating.

### §3705. Benefits
* (a) A member of the Reserve on active duty, on inactive-duty training, or engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, is entitled to the same benefits as a member of the Navy Reserve of corresponding grade, rating, and length of service. In determining length of service for the purpose of this section, there shall be included all service for which credit is given by law to members of the Regular Coast Guard.

* (b) Chapter 27 of this title applies to a member of the Reserve under the same conditions and limitations as it applies to a member of the Regular Coast Guard.

* (c) A member of the Reserve who suffers sickness, disease, disability, or death is entitled to the same benefits as prescribed by law for a member of the Navy Reserve who suffers sickness, disease, disability, or death under similar conditions.

* (d) A member of the Reserve on active duty or when retired for disability is entitled to the benefits of section 253(a) of title 42. A member of the Reserve when on active duty (other than for training) or when retired for disability is entitled to the benefits of chapter 55 of title 10.

* (e) A member of the Reserve, except an enlisted member retiring on the basis of years of active service, is entitled to the same retirement rights, benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law for a member of the Navy Reserve, and wherever a law confers authority upon the Secretary of the Navy, similar authority is given to the Secretary to be exercised with respect to the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy. An enlisted member of the Reserve who retires on the basis of years of active service is entitled to the same retirement rights, benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law for an enlisted member of the Regular Coast Guard.

* (f) A member of the Coast Guard Reserve not on active duty who is enrolled in an officer candidate program authorized by section 12209 of title 10 leading to a commission in the Coast Guard Reserve, and is a full-time student in an accredited college curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree may be paid a subsistence allowance for each month of the member's academic year at the same rate as that prescribed by section 209(a) of title 37.

### §3706. Temporary members of the Reserve; eligibility and compensation
* A citizen of the United States, its territories, or possessions who is a member of the Auxiliary, an officer or member of the crew of a motorboat or yacht placed at the disposal of the Coast Guard, or an individual (including a Government employee without pay other than the compensation of that individual's civilian position) who by reason of special training and experience is considered by the Commandant to be qualified for duty, may be enrolled by the Commandant as a temporary member of the Reserve, for duty under conditions the Commandant may prescribe, including part-time and intermittent active duty with or without pay, without regard to age. The Commandant is authorized to define the powers and duties of temporary members of the Reserve, and to confer upon them, appropriate to their qualifications and experience, the same grades and ratings as provided for members of the Reserve. When performing active duty with pay as authorized by this section, temporary members of the Reserve are entitled to receive the pay and allowances of their rank, grade, or rating.

### §3707. Temporary members of the Reserve; disability or death benefits
* (a) If a temporary member of the Reserve is physically injured, or dies as a result of physical injury, and the injury is incurred incident to service while performing active duty, or engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, the law authorizing compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries while in the performance of their duties, applies, subject to this section. That law shall be administered by the Secretary of Labor to the same extent as if the member was a civil employee of the United States and was injured in the performance of that duty. For benefit computation, regardless of pay or pay status, the member is considered to have had monthly pay of the monthly equivalent of the minimum rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS–9 of the General Schedule on the date the injury is incurred.

* (b) This section does not apply if the workmen's compensation law of a State, a territory, or another jurisdiction provides coverage because of a concurrent employment status of the temporary member. When the temporary member or a dependent is entitled to a benefit under this section and also to a concurrent benefit from the United States on account of the same disability or death, the temporary member or dependent, as appropriate, shall elect which benefit to receive.

* (c) If a claim is filed under this section with the Secretary of Labor for benefits because of an alleged injury or death, the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Commandant who shall direct an investigation into the facts surrounding the alleged injury or death. The Commandant shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the injured or deceased individual was a temporary member of the Reserve, the individual's military status, and whether or not the injury or death was incurred incident to military service.

* (d) A temporary member of the Reserve, who incurs a physical disability or contracts sickness or disease while performing a duty to which the member has been assigned by competent authority, is entitled to the same hospital treatment afforded a member of the Regular Coast Guard.

* (e) In administering section 8133 of title 5, for an individual covered by this section—

  * (1) the percentages applicable to payments under that section are—

    * (A) 45 percent under subsection (a)(2) of that section, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), with no additional payments for a child or children so long as the widow or widower remains eligible for payments under that subsection;

    * (B) 20 percent under subsection (a)(3) of that section, for one child, and 10 percent additional for each additional child, not to exceed a total of 75 percent, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act; and

    * (C) 25 percent under subsection (a)(4) of that section, if one parent was wholly dependent for support upon the deceased member at the time of the member's death and the other was not dependent to any extent; 16 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; and if one was, or both were, partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor;


  * (2) payments may not be made under subsection (a)(5) of that section; and

  * (3) the Secretary of Labor shall inform the Commissioner of Social Security whenever a claim is filed and eligibility for compensation is established under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of section 8133 of title 5. The Commissioner of Social Security shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the member concerned was fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act at the time of the member's death.

### §3708. Temporary members of the Reserve; certificate of honorable service
* In recognition of the service of temporary members of the Reserve, the Secretary may upon request issue an appropriate certificate of honorable service in lieu of a certificate of disenrollment issued to any individual following disenrollment under honorable conditions from service as a temporary member. Issuance of a certificate of honorable service to any individual under this section does not entitle that individual to any rights, privileges, or benefits under any law of the United States.

### §3709. Reserve student aviation pilots; Reserve aviation pilots; appointments in commissioned grade
* (a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary an enlisted member of the Reserve may be designated as a student aviation pilot.

* (b) A member who is not a qualified aviator may not be designated as a student aviation pilot unless the member agrees in writing to serve on active duty for a period of two years after successful completion of flight training, unless sooner released. A student aviation pilot may be released from active duty or discharged at any time as provided for in the regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

* (c) A student aviation pilot who is a qualified civilian aviator may be given a brief refresher course in flight training.

* (d) A student aviation pilot undergoing flight training is entitled to have uniforms and equipment provided at Government expense.

* (e) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a student aviation pilot may be designated an aviation pilot upon the successful completion of flight training.

* (f) In time of peace, an aviation pilot obligated under subsection (b) to serve on active duty for two years may serve for an additional period of not more than two years.

* (g) An aviation pilot may be released from active duty or discharged at any time as provided for in the regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

* (h) If qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an aviation pilot may be appointed as an ensign in the Reserve.

### §3710. Reserve student pre-commissioning assistance program
* (a) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to an eligible enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve, not on active duty, for expenses of the member while the member is pursuing on a full-time basis at an institution of higher education a program of education approved by the Secretary that leads to—

  * (1) a baccalaureate degree in not more than 5 academic years; or

  * (2) a post-baccalaureate degree.


* (b)(1) To be eligible for financial assistance under this section, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve shall—

  * (A) be enrolled on a full-time basis in a program of education referred to in subsection (a) at any institution of higher education; and

  * (B) enter into a written agreement with the Coast Guard described in paragraph (2).


* (2) A written agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is an agreement between the member and the Secretary in which the member agrees—

  * (A) to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve, if tendered;

  * (B) to serve on active duty for up to five years; and

  * (C) under such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, to serve in the Coast Guard Reserve until the eighth anniversary of the date of the appointment.


* (c) Expenses for which financial assistance may be provided under this section are the following:

  * (1) Tuition and fees charged by the institution of higher education involved.

  * (2) The cost of books.

  * (3) In the case of a program of education leading to a baccalaureate degree, laboratory expenses.

  * (4) Such other expenses as are deemed appropriate by the Secretary.


* (d) The amount of financial assistance provided to a member under this section shall be prescribed by the Secretary, but may not exceed $25,000 for any academic year.

* (e) Financial assistance may be provided to a member under this section for up to 5 consecutive academic years.

* (f) A member who receives financial assistance under this section may be ordered to active duty in the Coast Guard Reserve by the Secretary to serve in a designated enlisted grade for such period as the Secretary prescribes, but not more than 4 years, if the member—

  * (1) completes the academic requirements of the program and refuses to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve when offered;

  * (2) fails to complete the academic requirements of the institution of higher education involved; or

  * (3) fails to maintain eligibility for an original appointment as a commissioned officer.


* (g)(1) If a member requests to be released from the program and the request is accepted by the Secretary, or if the member fails because of misconduct to complete the period of active duty specified, or if the member fails to fulfill any term or condition of the written agreement required to be eligible for financial assistance under this section, the financial assistance shall be terminated. The Secretary may request the member to reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total costs of the education provided to that member as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty the member agreed to serve. The Secretary shall have the option to order such reimbursement without first ordering the member to active duty. An obligation to reimburse the United States imposed under this paragraph is a debt owed to the United States.

* (2) The Secretary may waive the service obligated under subsection (f) of a member who becomes unqualified to serve on active duty due to a circumstance not within the control of that member or who is not physically qualified for appointment and who is determined to be unqualified for service as an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve due to a physical or medical condition that was not the result of the member's own misconduct or grossly negligent conduct.

* (3) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is entered less than 5 years after the termination of a written agreement entered into under subsection (b) does not discharge the individual signing the agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph (1).

* (h) As used in this section, the term "institution of higher education" has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).

### §3711. Appointment or wartime promotion; retention of grade upon release from active duty
* (a) A member of the Reserve on active duty, who is appointed or promoted under section 2104 or 2125 of this title, is entitled upon release from that duty to the highest grade satisfactorily held by reason of that appointment or promotion. The Secretary shall determine the highest grade satisfactorily held.

* (b) Unless otherwise entitled to a higher grade, a member recalled to active duty shall be recalled in the grade in which released under subsection (a).

### §3712. Exclusiveness of service
* No member of the Reserve, other than a temporary member, may be a member of another military organization. A temporary member of the Reserve who is a member of another military component shall, if ordered to active duty therein, be disenrolled as a temporary member of the Reserve.

### §3713. Active duty for emergency augmentation of regular forces

* (b) Under the circumstances of the domestic emergency involved, a reasonable time shall be allowed between the date when a Reserve member ordered to active duty under this section is alerted for that duty and the date when the member is required to enter upon that duty. Unless the Secretary determines that the nature of the domestic emergency does not allow it, this period shall be at least two days.

* (c) Active duty served under this section—

  * (1) satisfies on a day-for-day basis all or a part of the annual active duty for training requirement of section 10147 of title 10;

  * (2) does not satisfy any part of the active duty obligation of a member whose statutory Reserve obligation is not already terminated; and

  * (3) entitles a member while engaged therein, or while engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, to all rights and benefits, including pay and allowances and time creditable for pay and retirement purposes, to which the member would be entitled while performing other active duty.


* (d) Reserve members ordered to active duty under this section shall not be counted in computing authorized strength of members on active duty or members in grade under this title or under any other law.

* (e) For purposes of calculating the duration of active duty allowed pursuant to subsection (a), each period of active duty shall begin on the first day that a member reports to active duty, including for purposes of training.

### §3714. Enlistment of members engaged in schooling
* The initial period of active duty for training required by section 12103(d) of title 10, may be divided into two successive annual periods of not less than six weeks each, to permit the enlistment of a Reserve member without interrupting any full-time schooling in which the member is engaged.
