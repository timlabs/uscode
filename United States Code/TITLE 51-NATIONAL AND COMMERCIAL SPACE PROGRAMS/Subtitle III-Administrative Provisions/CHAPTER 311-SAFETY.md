* (c) PROHIBITION ON SERVICE.—

  * (1) PROHIBITION UNLESS PROGRAM OF REHABILITATION COMPLETED.—No individual who is determined by the Administrator under this section to have used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance after December 9, 1991, shall serve as an Administration employee with responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or national security functions (as determined by the Administrator), or as an Administration contractor employee with such responsibility, unless such individual has completed a program of rehabilitation described in subsection (d).

    * (A) engaged in such use while on duty;

    * (B) prior to such use had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation program described in subsection (d);

    * (C) following such determination refuses to undertake such a rehabilitation program; or

Each contractor is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to those employees referred to in subsection (b)(2).

  * (5) provide that each specimen sample be subdivided, secured, and labelled in the presence of the tested individual and that a portion thereof be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that in the event the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained portion assayed by a confirmation test done independently at a second certified laboratory if the individual requests the independent test within 3 days after being advised of the results of the initial confirmation test;

  * (6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations as may be necessary and in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services;
