### TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Rule 25. Filing and Service
* (a) FILING.

  * (1) _Filing with the Clerk._ A paper required or permitted to be filed in a court of appeals must be filed with the clerk.

  * (2) _Filing: Method and Timeliness._

    * (A) _Nonelectronic Filing._

      * (i) _In General._ For a paper not filed electronically, filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.

      * (ii) _A Brief or Appendix._ A brief or appendix not filed electronically is timely filed, however, if on or before the last day for filing, it is:

        * • mailed to the clerk by first-class mail, or other class of mail that is at least as expeditious, postage prepaid; or

        * • dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery to the clerk within 3 days.


      * (iii) _Inmate Filing._ If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 25(a)(2)(A)(iii). A paper not filed electronically by an inmate is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:

        * • it is accompanied by: a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the paper was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or

        * • the court of appeals exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies Rule 25(a)(2)(A)(iii).


    * (B) _Electronic Filing and Signing._

      * (i) _By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Exceptions._ A person represented by an attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule.

      * (ii) _By an Unrepresented Person—When Allowed or Required._ A person not represented by an attorney:

        * • may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and

        * • may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that includes reasonable exceptions.


      * (iii) _Signing._ A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature.

      * (iv) _Same as a Written Paper._ A paper filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of these rules.


  * (3) _Filing a Motion with a Judge._ If a motion requests relief that may be granted by a single judge, the judge may permit the motion to be filed with the judge; the judge must note the filing date on the motion and give it to the clerk.

  * (4) _Clerk's Refusal of Documents._ The clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or by any local rule or practice.

  * (5) _Privacy Protection._ An appeal in a case whose privacy protection was governed by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9037, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 is governed by the same rule on appeal. In all other proceedings, privacy protection is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, except that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 governs when an extraordinary writ is sought in a criminal case.


* (b) SERVICE OF ALL PAPERS REQUIRED. Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of filing a paper, serve a copy on the other parties to the appeal or review. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.

* (c) MANNER OF SERVICE.

  * (1) Nonelectronic service may be any of the following:

    * (A) personal, including delivery to a responsible person at the office of counsel;

    * (B) by mail; or

    * (C) by third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days.


  * (2) Electronic service of a paper may be made (A) by sending it to a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or (B) by sending it by other electronic means that the person to be served consented to in writing.

  * (3) When reasonable considering such factors as the immediacy of the relief sought, distance, and cost, service on a party must be by a manner at least as expeditious as the manner used to file the paper with the court.

  * (4) Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier. Service by electronic means is complete on filing or sending, unless the party making service is notified that the paper was not received by the party served.


* (d) PROOF OF SERVICE.

  * (1) A paper presented for filing must contain either of the following if it was served other than through the court's electronic-filing system:

    * (A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or

    * (B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:

      * (i) the date and manner of service;

      * (ii) the names of the persons served; and

      * (iii) their mail or electronic addresses, facsimile numbers, or the addresses of the places of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service.


  * (2) When a brief or appendix is filed by mailing or dispatch in accordance with Rule 25(a)(2)(A)(ii), the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which the document was mailed or dispatched to the clerk.

  * (3) Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the papers filed.


* (e) NUMBER OF COPIES. When these rules require the filing or furnishing of a number of copies, a court may require a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.

### Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time
* (a) COMPUTING TIME. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.

  * (1) _Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit._ When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:

    * (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (2) _Period Stated in Hours._ When the period is stated in hours:

    * (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;

    * (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

    * (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (3) _Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office._ Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:

    * (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 26(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or

    * (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 26(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


  * (4) _"Last Day" Defined._ Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:

    * (A) for electronic filing in the district court, at midnight in the court's time zone;

    * (B) for electronic filing in the court of appeals, at midnight in the time zone of the circuit clerk's principal office;

    * (C) for filing under Rules 4(c)(1), 25(a)(2)(A)(ii), and 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)—and filing by mail under Rule 13(a)(2)—at the latest time for the method chosen for delivery to the post office, third-party commercial carrier, or prison mailing system; and

    * (D) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.


  * (5) _"Next Day" Defined._ The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.

  * (6) _"Legal Holiday" Defined._ "Legal holiday" means:

    * (A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;

    * (B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and

    * (C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where either of the following is located: the district court that rendered the challenged judgment or order, or the circuit clerk's principal office.


* (b) EXTENDING TIME. For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules or by its order to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires. But the court may not extend the time to file:

  * (1) a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4) or a petition for permission to appeal; or

  * (2) a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, enforce, or otherwise review an order of an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer of the United States, unless specifically authorized by law.


* (c) ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER CERTAIN KINDS OF SERVICE. When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served, and the paper is not served electronically on the party or delivered to the party on the date stated in the proof of service, 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 26(a).

### Rule 26.1. Disclosure Statement
* (a) NONGOVERNMENTAL CORPORATIONS. Any nongovernmental corporation that is a party to a proceeding in a court of appeals must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.

* (b) ORGANIZATIONAL VICTIMS IN CRIMINAL CASES. In a criminal case, unless the government shows good cause, it must file a statement that identifies any organizational victim of the alleged criminal activity. If the organizational victim is a corporation, the statement must also disclose the information required by Rule 26.1(a) to the extent it can be obtained through due diligence.

* (c) BANKRUPTCY CASES. In a bankruptcy case, the debtor, the trustee, or, if neither is a party, the appellant must file a statement that:

  * (1) identifies each debtor not named in the caption; and

  * (2) for each debtor that is a corporation, discloses the information required by Rule 26.1(a).


* (d) TIME FOR FILING; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. The Rule 26.1 statement must:

  * (1) be filed with the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the court of appeals, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing;

  * (2) be included before the table of contents in the principal brief; and

  * (3) be supplemented whenever the information required under Rule 26.1 changes.


* (e) NUMBER OF COPIES. If the Rule 26.1 statement is filed before the principal brief, or if a supplemental statement is filed, an original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.

### Rule 27. Motions
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Application for Relief._ An application for an order or other relief is made by motion unless these rules prescribe another form. A motion must be in writing unless the court permits otherwise.

  * (2) _Contents of a Motion._

    * (A) _Grounds and Relief Sought._ A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.

    * (B) _Accompanying Documents._

      * (i) Any affidavit or other paper necessary to support a motion must be served and filed with the motion.

      * (ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.

      * (iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the trial court's opinion or agency's decision as a separate exhibit.


    * (C) _Documents Barred or Not Required._

      * (i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.

      * (ii) A notice of motion is not required.

      * (iii) A proposed order is not required.


  * (3) _Response._

    * (A) _Time to file._ Any party may file a response to a motion; Rule 27(a)(2) governs its contents. The response must be filed within 10 days after service of the motion unless the court shortens or extends the time. A motion authorized by Rules 8, 9, 18, or 41 may be granted before the 10-day period runs only if the court gives reasonable notice to the parties that it intends to act sooner.

    * (B) _Request for Affirmative Relief._ A response may include a motion for affirmative relief. The time to respond to the new motion, and to reply to that response, are governed by Rule 27(a)(3)(A) and (a)(4). The title of the response must alert the court to the request for relief.


  * (4) _Reply to Response._ Any reply to a response must be filed within 7 days after service of the response. A reply must not present matters that do not relate to the response.


* (b) DISPOSITION OF A MOTION FOR A PROCEDURAL ORDER. The court may act on a motion for a procedural order—including a motion under Rule 26(b)—at any time without awaiting a response, and may, by rule or by order in a particular case, authorize its clerk to act on specified types of procedural motions. A party adversely affected by the court's, or the clerk's, action may file a motion to reconsider, vacate, or modify that action. Timely opposition filed after the motion is granted in whole or in part does not constitute a request to reconsider, vacate, or modify the disposition; a motion requesting that relief must be filed.

* (c) POWER OF A SINGLE JUDGE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION. A circuit judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding. A court of appeals may provide by rule or by order in a particular case that only the court may act on any motion or class of motions. The court may review the action of a single judge.

* (d) FORM OF PAPERS; LENGTH LIMITS; NUMBER OF COPIES.

  * (1) _Format._

    * (A) _Reproduction._ A motion, response, or reply may be reproduced by any process that yields a clear black image on light paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one side of the paper may be used.

    * (B) _Cover._ A cover is not required, but there must be a caption that includes the case number, the name of the court, the title of the case, and a brief descriptive title indicating the purpose of the motion and identifying the party or parties for whom it is filed. If a cover is used, it must be white.

    * (C) _Binding._ The document must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the text, and permits the document to lie reasonably flat when open.

    * (D) _Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins._ The document must be on 8½ by 11 inch paper. The text must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.

    * (E) _Typeface and Type Styles._ The document must comply with the typeface requirements of Rule 32(a)(5) and the type-style requirements of Rule 32(a)(6).


  * (2) _Length Limits._ Except by the court's permission, and excluding the accompanying documents authorized by Rule 27(a)(2)(B):

    * (D) a handwritten or typewritten reply to a response must not exceed 10 pages.


  * (3) _Number of Copies._ An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.

### Rule 28. Briefs
* (a) APPELLANT'S BRIEF. The appellant's brief must contain, under appropriate headings and in the order indicated:

  * (1) a disclosure statement if required by Rule 26.1;

  * (2) a table of contents, with page references;

  * (3) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;

  * (4) a jurisdictional statement, including:

    * (A) the basis for the district court's or agency's subject-matter jurisdiction, with citations to applicable statutory provisions and stating relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;

    * (B) the basis for the court of appeals' jurisdiction, with citations to applicable statutory provisions and stating relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;

    * (C) the filing dates establishing the timeliness of the appeal or petition for review; and

    * (D) an assertion that the appeal is from a final order or judgment that disposes of all parties' claims, or information establishing the court of appeals' jurisdiction on some other basis;


  * (5) a statement of the issues presented for review;

  * (6) a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for review, describing the relevant procedural history, and identifying the rulings presented for review, with appropriate references to the record (see Rule 28(e));

  * (7) a summary of the argument, which must contain a succinct, clear, and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and which must not merely repeat the argument headings;

  * (8) the argument, which must contain:

    * (A) appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies; and

  * (9) a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought; and

  * (10) the certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(g)(1).


* (b) APPELLEE'S BRIEF. The appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of Rule 28(a)(1)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement:

A reply brief must contain a table of contents, with page references, and a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities—with references to the pages of the reply brief where they are cited.

* (d) REFERENCES TO PARTIES. In briefs and at oral argument, counsel should minimize use of the terms "appellant" and "appellee." To make briefs clear, counsel should use the parties' actual names or the designations used in the lower court or agency proceeding, or such descriptive terms as "the employee," "the injured person," "the taxpayer," "the ship," "the stevedore."

* (e) REFERENCES TO THE RECORD. References to the parts of the record contained in the appendix filed with the appellant's brief must be to the pages of the appendix. If the appendix is prepared after the briefs are filed, a party referring to the record must follow one of the methods detailed in Rule 30(c). If the original record is used under Rule 30(f) and is not consecutively paginated, or if the brief refers to an unreproduced part of the record, any reference must be to the page of the original document. For example:

  * • Answer p. 7;

  * • Motion for Judgment p. 2;

  * • Transcript p. 231.


* Only clear abbreviations may be used. A party referring to evidence whose admissibility is in controversy must cite the pages of the appendix or of the transcript at which the evidence was identified, offered, and received or rejected.

* (f) REPRODUCTION OF STATUTES, RULES, REGULATIONS, ETC. If the court's determination of the issues presented requires the study of statutes, rules, regulations, etc., the relevant parts must be set out in the brief or in an addendum at the end, or may be supplied to the court in pamphlet form.

* (g) [RESERVED]

* (h) [RESERVED]

* (i) BRIEFS IN A CASE INVOLVING MULTIPLE APPELLANTS OR APPELLEES. In a case involving more than one appellant or appellee, including consolidated cases, any number of appellants or appellees may join in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of another's brief. Parties may also join in reply briefs.

* (j) CITATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITIES. If pertinent and significant authorities come to a party's attention after the party's brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before decision—a party may promptly advise the circuit clerk by letter, with a copy to all other parties, setting forth the citations. The letter must state the reasons for the supplemental citations, referring either to the page of the brief or to a point argued orally. The body of the letter must not exceed 350 words. Any response must be made promptly and must be similarly limited.

### Rule 28.1. Cross-Appeals
* (a) APPLICABILITY. This rule applies to a case in which a cross-appeal is filed. Rules 28(a)–(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2), and 32(a)(7)(A)–(B) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise provided in this rule.

* (b) DESIGNATION OF APPELLANT. The party who files a notice of appeal first is the appellant for the purposes of this rule and Rules 30 and 34.

  * (1) _Applicability._ This Rule 29(a) governs amicus filings during a court's initial consideration of a case on the merits.

  * (2) _When Permitted._ The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing, but a court of appeals may prohibit the filing of or may strike an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification.

  * (3) _Motion for Leave to File._ The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:

    * (A) the movant's interest; and

In addition to the requirements of Rule 32, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 28, but must include the following:

    * (A) if the amicus curiae is a corporation, a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 26.1;

    * (B) a table of contents, with page references;

      * (i) a party's counsel authored the brief in whole or in part;

      * (ii) a party or a party's counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; and

      * (iii) a person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel—contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such person;


    * (F) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and which need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review; and

    * (G) a certificate of compliance under Rule 32(g)(1), if length is computed using a word or line limit.


  * (5) _Length._ Except by the court's permission, an amicus brief may be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.

  * (6) _Time for Filing._ An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. A court may grant leave for later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.

  * (7) _Reply Brief._ Except by the court's permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply brief.

  * (8) _Oral Argument._ An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the court's permission.


* (b) DURING CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER TO GRANT REHEARING.

  * (1)_Applicability._ This Rule 29(b) governs amicus filings during a court's consideration of whether to grant panel rehearing or rehearing en banc, unless a local rule or order in a case provides otherwise.

  * (2) _When Permitted._ The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court.

  * (3) _Motion for Leave to File._ Rule 29(a)(3) applies to a motion for leave.

  * (4) _Contents, Form, and Length._ Rule 29(a)(4) applies to the amicus brief. The brief must not exceed 2,600 words.

  * (1) _Contents of the Appendix._ The appellant must prepare and file an appendix to the briefs containing:

    * (A) the relevant docket entries in the proceeding below;

    * (B) the relevant portions of the pleadings, charge, findings, or opinion;

    * (C) the judgment, order, or decision in question; and

    * (D) other parts of the record to which the parties wish to direct the court's attention.


  * (2) _Excluded Material._ Memoranda of law in the district court should not be included in the appendix unless they have independent relevance. Parts of the record may be relied on by the court or the parties even though not included in the appendix.

  * (3) _Time to File; Number of Copies._ Unless filing is deferred under Rule 30(c), the appellant must file 10 copies of the appendix with the brief and must serve one copy on counsel for each party separately represented. An unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis must file 4 legible copies with the clerk, and one copy must be served on counsel for each separately represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a particular case require the filing or service of a different number.


* (b) ALL PARTIES' RESPONSIBILITIES.

  * (1) _Determining the Contents of the Appendix._ The parties are encouraged to agree on the contents of the appendix. In the absence of an agreement, the appellant must, within 14 days after the record is filed, serve on the appellee a designation of the parts of the record the appellant intends to include in the appendix and a statement of the issues the appellant intends to present for review. The appellee may, within 14 days after receiving the designation, serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to which it wishes to direct the court's attention. The appellant must include the designated parts in the appendix. The parties must not engage in unnecessary designation of parts of the record, because the entire record is available to the court. This paragraph applies also to a cross-appellant and a cross-appellee.

  * (2) _Costs of Appendix._ Unless the parties agree otherwise, the appellant must pay the cost of the appendix. If the appellant considers parts of the record designated by the appellee to be unnecessary, the appellant may advise the appellee, who must then advance the cost of including those parts. The cost of the appendix is a taxable cost. But if any party causes unnecessary parts of the record to be included in the appendix, the court may impose the cost of those parts on that party. Each circuit must, by local rule, provide for sanctions against attorneys who unreasonably and vexatiously increase litigation costs by including unnecessary material in the appendix.


* (c) DEFERRED APPENDIX.

  * (1) _Deferral Until After Briefs Are Filed._ The court may provide by rule for classes of cases or by order in a particular case that preparation of the appendix may be deferred until after the briefs have been filed and that the appendix may be filed 21 days after the appellee's brief is served. Even though the filing of the appendix may be deferred, Rule 30(b) applies; except that a party must designate the parts of the record it wants included in the appendix when it serves its brief, and need not include a statement of the issues presented.

  * (2) _References to the Record._

    * (A) If the deferred appendix is used, the parties may cite in their briefs the pertinent pages of the record. When the appendix is prepared, the record pages cited in the briefs must be indicated by inserting record page numbers, in brackets, at places in the appendix where those pages of the record appear.

    * (B) A party who wants to refer directly to pages of the appendix may serve and file copies of the brief within the time required by Rule 31(a), containing appropriate references to pertinent pages of the record. In that event, within 14 days after the appendix is filed, the party must serve and file copies of the brief, containing references to the pages of the appendix in place of or in addition to the references to the pertinent pages of the record. Except for the correction of typographical errors, no other changes may be made to the brief.


* (d) FORMAT OF THE APPENDIX. The appendix must begin with a table of contents identifying the page at which each part begins. The relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents. Other parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from the transcript of proceedings are placed in the appendix, the transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets immediately before the included pages. Omissions in the text of papers or of the transcript must be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, etc.) should be omitted.

* (e) REPRODUCTION OF EXHIBITS. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the appendix may be reproduced in a separate volume, or volumes, suitably indexed. Four copies must be filed with the appendix, and one copy must be served on counsel for each separately represented party. If a transcript of a proceeding before an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer was used in a district-court action and has been designated for inclusion in the appendix, the transcript must be placed in the appendix as an exhibit.

* (f) APPEAL ON THE ORIGINAL RECORD WITHOUT AN APPENDIX. The court may, either by rule for all cases or classes of cases or by order in a particular case, dispense with the appendix and permit an appeal to proceed on the original record with any copies of the record, or relevant parts, that the court may order the parties to file.

### Rule 31. Serving and Filing Briefs
* (a) TIME TO SERVE AND FILE A BRIEF.

  * (1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 40 days after the record is filed. The appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the appellant's brief is served. The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 21 days after service of the appellee's brief but a reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before argument, unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing.

  * (2) A court of appeals that routinely considers cases on the merits promptly after the briefs are filed may shorten the time to serve and file briefs, either by local rule or by order in a particular case.


* (b) NUMBER OF COPIES. Twenty-five copies of each brief must be filed with the clerk and 2 copies must be served on each unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately represented party. An unrepresented party proceeding in forma pauperis must file 4 legible copies with the clerk, and one copy must be served on each unrepresented party and on counsel for each separately represented party. The court may by local rule or by order in a particular case require the filing or service of a different number.

* (c) CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO FILE. If an appellant fails to file a brief within the time provided by this rule, or within an extended time, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal. An appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral argument unless the court grants permission.

### Rule 32. Form of Briefs, Appendices, and Other Papers
* (a) FORM OF A BRIEF.

  * (1) _Reproduction._

    * (A) A brief may be reproduced by any process that yields a clear black image on light paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one side of the paper may be used.

    * (B) Text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer.

    * (C) Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced by any method that results in a good copy of the original; a glossy finish is acceptable if the original is glossy.


  * (2) _Cover._ Except for filings by unrepresented parties, the cover of the appellant's brief must be blue; the appellee's, red; an intervenor's or amicus curiae's, green; any reply brief, gray; and any supplemental brief, tan. The front cover of a brief must contain:

    * (A) the number of the case centered at the top;

    * (B) the name of the court;

    * (C) the title of the case (see Rule 12(a));

    * (D) the nature of the proceeding (e.g., Appeal, Petition for Review) and the name of the court, agency, or board below;

    * (E) the title of the brief, identifying the party or parties for whom the brief is filed; and

    * (F) the name, office address, and telephone number of counsel representing the party for whom the brief is filed.


  * (3) _Binding_. The brief must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the text, and permits the brief to lie reasonably flat when open.

  * (4) _Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins._ The brief must be on 8½ by 11 inch paper. The text must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.

  * (5) _Typeface._ Either a proportionally spaced or a monospaced face may be used.

    * (A) A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type may be used in headings and captions. A proportionally spaced face must be 14-point or larger.

    * (B) A monospaced face may not contain more than 10½ characters per inch.


  * (6) _Type Styles._ A brief must be set in a plain, roman style, although italics or boldface may be used for emphasis. Case names must be italicized or underlined.

  * (7) _Length._

    * (A) _Page Limitation._ A principal brief may not exceed 30 pages, or a reply brief 15 pages, unless it complies with Rule 32(a)(7)(B).

    * (B) _Type-Volume Limitation._

      * (i) A principal brief is acceptable if it:

        * • contains no more than 13,000 words; or

        * • uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.


      * (ii) A reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more than half of the type volume specified in Rule 32(a)(7)(B)(i).


* (b) FORM OF AN APPENDIX. An appendix must comply with Rule 32(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4), with the following exceptions:

  * (1) The cover of a separately bound appendix must be white.

  * (2) An appendix may include a legible photocopy of any document found in the record or of a printed judicial or agency decision.

  * (3) When necessary to facilitate inclusion of odd-sized documents such as technical drawings, an appendix may be a size other than 8½ by 11 inches, and need not lie reasonably flat when opened.


* (c) FORM OF OTHER PAPERS.

  * (1) _Motion._ The form of a motion is governed by Rule 27(d).

  * (2) _Other Papers._ Any other paper, including a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for hearing or rehearing en banc, and any response to such a petition, must be reproduced in the manner prescribed by Rule 32(a), with the following exceptions:

    * (A) A cover is not necessary if the caption and signature page of the paper together contain the information required by Rule 32(a)(2). If a cover is used, it must be white.

    * (B) Rule 32(a)(7) does not apply.


* (d) SIGNATURE. Every brief, motion, or other paper filed with the court must be signed by the party filing the paper or, if the party is represented, by one of the party's attorneys.

* (e) LOCAL VARIATION. Every court of appeals must accept documents that comply with the form requirements of this rule and the length limits set by these rules. By local rule or order in a particular case, a court of appeals may accept documents that do not meet all the form requirements of this rule or the length limits set by these rules.

* (f) ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM LENGTH. In computing any length limit, headings, footnotes, and quotations count toward the limit but the following items do not:

  * • cover page;

  * • disclosure statement;

  * • table of contents;

  * • table of citations;

  * • statement regarding oral argument;

  * • addendum containing statutes, rules, or regulations;

  * • certificate of counsel;

  * • signature block;

  * • proof of service; and

  * • any item specifically excluded by these rules or by local rule.


* (g) CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.

  * (1) _Briefs and Papers That Require a Certificate._ A brief submitted under Rules 28.1(e)(2), 29(b)(4), or 32(a)(7)(B)—and a paper submitted under Rules 5(c)(1), 21(d)(1), 27(d)(2)(A), 27(d)(2)(C), 35(b)(2)(A), or 40(b)(1)—must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, that the document complies with the type-volume limitation. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word or line count of the word-processing system used to prepare the document. The certificate must state the number of words—or the number of lines of monospaced type—in the document.

  * (2) _Acceptable Form._ Form 6 in the Appendix of Forms meets the requirements for a certificate of compliance.

### Rule 32.1. Citing Judicial Dispositions
* (a) CITATION PERMITTED. A court may not prohibit or restrict the citation of federal judicial opinions, orders, judgments, or other written dispositions that have been:

  * (i) designated as "unpublished," "not for publication," "non-precedential," "not precedent," or the like; and

  * (ii) issued on or after January 1, 2007.


* (b) COPIES REQUIRED. If a party cites a federal judicial opinion, order, judgment, or other written disposition that is not available in a publicly accessible electronic database, the party must file and serve a copy of that opinion, order, judgment, or disposition with the brief or other paper in which it is cited.

### Rule 33. Appeal Conferences
* The court may direct the attorneys—and, when appropriate, the parties—to participate in one or more conferences to address any matter that may aid in disposing of the proceedings, including simplifying the issues and discussing settlement. A judge or other person designated by the court may preside over the conference, which may be conducted in person or by telephone. Before a settlement conference, the attorneys must consult with their clients and obtain as much authority as feasible to settle the case. The court may, as a result of the conference, enter an order controlling the course of the proceedings or implementing any settlement agreement.

### Rule 34. Oral Argument
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Party's Statement._ Any party may file, or a court may require by local rule, a statement explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.

  * (2) _Standards._ Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless a panel of three judges who have examined the briefs and record unanimously agrees that oral argument is unnecessary for any of the following reasons:

    * (A) the appeal is frivolous;

    * (B) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or

    * (C) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.


* (b) NOTICE OF ARGUMENT; POSTPONEMENT. The clerk must advise all parties whether oral argument will be scheduled, and, if so, the date, time, and place for it, and the time allowed for each side. A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date.

* (c) ORDER AND CONTENTS OF ARGUMENT. The appellant opens and concludes the argument. Counsel must not read at length from briefs, records, or authorities.

* (d) CROSS-APPEALS AND SEPARATE APPEALS. If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 28.1(b) determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for purposes of oral argument. Unless the court directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.

* (e) NONAPPEARANCE OF A PARTY. If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the court must hear appellant's argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the court may hear the appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs, unless the court orders otherwise.

* (f) SUBMISSION ON BRIEFS. The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs, but the court may direct that the case be argued.

* (g) USE OF PHYSICAL EXHIBITS AT ARGUMENT; REMOVAL. Counsel intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the exhibits from the courtroom, unless the court directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives notice to remove them.

### Rule 35. En Banc Determination
* (a) WHEN HEARING OR REHEARING EN BANC MAY BE ORDERED. A majority of the circuit judges who are in regular active service and who are not disqualified may order that an appeal or other proceeding be heard or reheard by the court of appeals en banc. An en banc hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless:

  * (1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's decisions; or

  * (2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.


* (b) PETITION FOR HEARING OR REHEARING EN BANC. A party may petition for a hearing or rehearing en banc.

  * (1) The petition must begin with a statement that either:

    * (A) the panel decision conflicts with a decision of the United States Supreme Court or of the court to which the petition is addressed (with citation to the conflicting case or cases) and consideration by the full court is therefore necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the court's decisions; or

    * (B) the proceeding involves one or more questions of exceptional importance, each of which must be concisely stated; for example, a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a question of exceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.


  * (2) Except by the court's permission:

    * (A) a petition for an en banc hearing or rehearing produced using a computer must not exceed 3,900 words; and

    * (B) a handwritten or typewritten petition for an en banc hearing or rehearing must not exceed 15 pages.


  * (3) For purposes of the limits in Rule 35(b)(2), if a party files both a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing en banc, they are considered a single document even if they are filed separately, unless separate filing is required by local rule.


* (c) TIME FOR PETITION FOR HEARING OR REHEARING EN BANC. A petition that an appeal be heard initially en banc must be filed by the date when the appellee's brief is due. A petition for a rehearing en banc must be filed within the time prescribed by Rule 40 for filing a petition for rehearing.

* (d) NUMBER OF COPIES. The number of copies to be filed must be prescribed by local rule and may be altered by order in a particular case.

* (e) RESPONSE. No response may be filed to a petition for an en banc consideration unless the court orders a response. The length limits in Rule 35(b)(2) apply to a response.

* (f) CALL FOR A VOTE. A vote need not be taken to determine whether the case will be heard or reheard en banc unless a judge calls for a vote.

### Rule 36. Entry of Judgment; Notice
* (a) ENTRY. A judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket. The clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment:

  * (1) after receiving the court's opinion—but if settlement of the judgment's form is required, after final settlement; or

  * (2) if a judgment is rendered without an opinion, as the court instructs.


* (b) NOTICE. On the date when judgment is entered, the clerk must serve on all parties a copy of the opinion—or the judgment, if no opinion was written—and a notice of the date when the judgment was entered.

### Rule 37. Interest on Judgment
* (a) WHEN THE COURT AFFIRMS. Unless the law provides otherwise, if a money judgment in a civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed by law is payable from the date when the district court's judgment was entered.

* (b) WHEN THE COURT REVERSES. If the court modifies or reverses a judgment with a direction that a money judgment be entered in the district court, the mandate must contain instructions about the allowance of interest.

### Rule 38. Frivolous Appeal—Damages and Costs
* If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.

### Rule 39. Costs
* (a) AGAINST WHOM ASSESSED. The following rules apply unless the law provides or the court orders otherwise:

  * (1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree otherwise;

  * (2) if a judgment is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;

  * (3) if a judgment is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;

  * (4) if a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the court orders.


* (b) COSTS FOR AND AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. Costs for or against the United States, its agency, or officer will be assessed under Rule 39(a) only if authorized by law.

* (c) COSTS OF COPIES. Each court of appeals must, by local rule, fix the maximum rate for taxing the cost of producing necessary copies of a brief or appendix, or copies of records authorized by Rule 30(f). The rate must not exceed that generally charged for such work in the area where the clerk's office is located and should encourage economical methods of copying.

* (d) BILL OF COSTS: OBJECTIONS; INSERTION IN MANDATE.

  * (1) A party who wants costs taxed must—within 14 days after entry of judgment—file with the circuit clerk and serve an itemized and verified bill of costs.

  * (2) Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the court extends the time.

  * (3) The clerk must prepare and certify an itemized statement of costs for insertion in the mandate, but issuance of the mandate must not be delayed for taxing costs. If the mandate issues before costs are finally determined, the district clerk must—upon the circuit clerk's request—add the statement of costs, or any amendment of it, to the mandate.


* (e) COSTS ON APPEAL TAXABLE IN THE DISTRICT COURT. The following costs on appeal are taxable in the district court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:

  * (1) the preparation and transmission of the record;

  * (2) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;

  * (3) premiums paid for a bond or other security to preserve rights pending appeal; and

  * (4) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.

### Rule 40. Petition for Panel Rehearing
* (a) TIME TO FILE; CONTENTS; RESPONSE; ACTION BY THE COURT IF GRANTED.

  * (1) _Time._ Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a petition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment. But in a civil case, unless an order shortens or extends the time, the petition may be filed by any party within 45 days after entry of judgment if one of the parties is:

    * (A) the United States;

    * (B) a United States agency;

    * (C) a United States officer or employee sued in an official capacity; or

    * (D) a current or former United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States' behalf—including all instances in which the United States represents that person when the court of appeals' judgment is entered or files the petition for that person.


  * (2) _Contents._ The petition must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the petitioner believes the court has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the petition. Oral argument is not permitted.

  * (3) _Response._ Unless the court requests, no response to a petition for panel rehearing is permitted. Ordinarily, rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request. If a response is requested, the requirements of Rule 40(b) apply to the response.

  * (4) _Action by the Court._ If a petition for panel rehearing is granted, the court may do any of the following:

    * (A) make a final disposition of the case without reargument;

    * (B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or

    * (C) issue any other appropriate order.


* (b) FORM OF PETITION; LENGTH. The petition must comply in form with Rule 32. Copies must be served and filed as Rule 31 prescribes. Except by the court's permission:

  * (1) a petition for panel rehearing produced using a computer must not exceed 3,900 words; and

  * (2) a handwritten or typewritten petition for panel rehearing must not exceed 15 pages.

### Rule 41. Mandate: Contents; Issuance and Effective Date; Stay
* (a) CONTENTS. Unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue, the mandate consists of a certified copy of the judgment, a copy of the court's opinion, if any, and any direction about costs.

* (b) WHEN ISSUED. The court's mandate must issue 7 days after the time to file a petition for rehearing expires, or 7 days after entry of an order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later. The court may shorten or extend the time by order.

* (c) EFFECTIVE DATE. The mandate is effective when issued.

* (d) STAYING THE MANDATE PENDING A PETITION FOR CERTIORARI.

  * (1) _Motion to Stay._ A party may move to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The motion must be served on all parties and must show that the petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.

  * (2) _Duration of Stay; Extensions._ The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless:

    * (A) the period is extended for good cause; or

    * (B) the party who obtained the stay notifies the circuit clerk in writing within the period of the stay:

      * (i) that the time for filing a petition has been extended, in which case the stay continues for the extended period; or

      * (ii) that the petition has been filed, in which case the stay continues until the Supreme Court's final disposition.


  * (3) _Security._ The court may require a bond or other security as a condition to granting or continuing a stay of the mandate.

  * (4) _Issuance of Mandate._ The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately on receiving a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition, unless extraordinary circumstances exist.

### Rule 42. Voluntary Dismissal
* (a) DISMISSAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT. Before an appeal has been docketed by the circuit clerk, the district court may dismiss the appeal on the filing of a stipulation signed by all parties or on the appellant's motion with notice to all parties.

* (b) DISMISSAL IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. The circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. But no mandate or other process may issue without a court order. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant's motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.

### Rule 43. Substitution of Parties
* (a) DEATH OF A PARTY.

  * (1) _After Notice of Appeal Is Filed._ If a party dies after a notice of appeal has been filed or while a proceeding is pending in the court of appeals, the decedent's personal representative may be substituted as a party on motion filed with the circuit clerk by the representative or by any party. A party's motion must be served on the representative in accordance with Rule 25. If the decedent has no representative, any party may suggest the death on the record, and the court of appeals may then direct appropriate proceedings.

  * (2) _Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed—Potential Appellant._ If a party entitled to appeal dies before filing a notice of appeal, the decedent's personal representative—or, if there is no personal representative, the decedent's attorney of record—may file a notice of appeal within the time prescribed by these rules. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution must be in accordance with Rule 43(a)(1).

  * (3) _Before Notice of Appeal Is Filed—Potential Appellee._ If a party against whom an appeal may be taken dies after entry of a judgment or order in the district court, but before a notice of appeal is filed, an appellant may proceed as if the death had not occurred. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution must be in accordance with Rule 43(a)(1).


* (b) SUBSTITUTION FOR A REASON OTHER THAN DEATH. If a party needs to be substituted for any reason other than death, the procedure prescribed in Rule 43(a) applies.

* (c) PUBLIC OFFICER: IDENTIFICATION; SUBSTITUTION.

  * (1) _Identification of Party._ A public officer who is a party to an appeal or other proceeding in an official capacity may be described as a party by the public officer's official title rather than by name. But the court may require the public officer's name to be added.

  * (2) _Automatic Substitution of Officeholder._ When a public officer who is a party to an appeal or other proceeding in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate. The public officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings following the substitution are to be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties may be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at any time, but failure to enter an order does not affect the substitution.

### Rule 44. Case Involving a Constitutional Question When the United States or the Relevant State is Not a Party
* (a) CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO FEDERAL STATUTE. If a party questions the constitutionality of an Act of Congress in a proceeding in which the United States or its agency, officer, or employee is not a party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals. The clerk must then certify that fact to the Attorney General.

* (b) CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO STATE STATUTE. If a party questions the constitutionality of a statute of a State in a proceeding in which that State or its agency, officer, or employee is not a party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals. The clerk must then certify that fact to the attorney general of the State.

### Rule 45. Clerk's Duties
* (a) GENERAL PROVISIONS.

  * (1) _Qualifications._ The circuit clerk must take the oath and post any bond required by law. Neither the clerk nor any deputy clerk may practice as an attorney or counselor in any court while in office.

  * (2) _When Court Is Open._ The court of appeals is always open for filing any paper, issuing and returning process, making a motion, and entering an order. The clerk's office with the clerk or a deputy in attendance must be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. A court may provide by local rule or by order that the clerk's office be open for specified hours on Saturdays or on legal holidays other than New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.


* (b) RECORDS.

  * (1) _The Docket._ The circuit clerk must maintain a docket and an index of all docketed cases in the manner prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The clerk must record all papers filed with the clerk and all process, orders, and judgments.

  * (2) _Calendar._ Under the court's direction, the clerk must prepare a calendar of cases awaiting argument. In placing cases on the calendar for argument, the clerk must give preference to appeals in criminal cases and to other proceedings and appeals entitled to preference by law.

  * (3) _Other Records._ The clerk must keep other books and records required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States, or by the court.


* (c) NOTICE OF AN ORDER OR JUDGMENT. Upon the entry of an order or judgment, the circuit clerk must immediately serve a notice of entry on each party, with a copy of any opinion, and must note the date of service on the docket. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on counsel.

* (d) CUSTODY OF RECORDS AND PAPERS. The circuit clerk has custody of the court's records and papers. Unless the court orders or instructs otherwise, the clerk must not permit an original record or paper to be taken from the clerk's office. Upon disposition of the case, original papers constituting the record on appeal or review must be returned to the court or agency from which they were received. The clerk must preserve a copy of any brief, appendix, or other paper that has been filed.

### Rule 46. Attorneys
* (a) ADMISSION TO THE BAR.

  * (1) _Eligibility._ An attorney is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of appeals if that attorney is of good moral and professional character and is admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of a state, another United States court of appeals, or a United States district court (including the district courts for Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands).

  * (2) _Application._ An applicant must file an application for admission, on a form approved by the court that contains the applicant's personal statement showing eligibility for membership. The applicant must subscribe to the following oath or affirmation:

  * "I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will conduct myself as an attorney and counselor of this court, uprightly and according to law; and that I will support the Constitution of the United States."


  * (3) _Admission Procedures._ On written or oral motion of a member of the court's bar, the court will act on the application. An applicant may be admitted by oral motion in open court. But, unless the court orders otherwise, an applicant need not appear before the court to be admitted. Upon admission, an applicant must pay the clerk the fee prescribed by local rule or court order.


* (b) SUSPENSION OR DISBARMENT.

  * (1) _Standard._ A member of the court's bar is subject to suspension or disbarment by the court if the member:

    * (A) has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any other court; or

    * (B) is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the court's bar.


  * (2) _Procedure._ The member must be given an opportunity to show good cause, within the time prescribed by the court, why the member should not be suspended or disbarred.

  * (3) _Order._ The court must enter an appropriate order after the member responds and a hearing is held, if requested, or after the time prescribed for a response expires, if no response is made.


* (c) DISCIPLINE. A court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule. First, however, the court must afford the attorney reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

### Rule 47. Local Rules by Courts of Appeals
* (a) LOCAL RULES.

  * (1) Each court of appeals acting by a majority of its judges in regular active service may, after giving appropriate public notice and opportunity for comment, make and amend rules governing its practice. A generally applicable direction to parties or lawyers regarding practice before a court must be in a local rule rather than an internal operating procedure or standing order. A local rule must be consistent with—but not duplicative of—Acts of Congress and rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. §2072 and must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Each circuit clerk must send the Administrative Office of the United States Courts a copy of each local rule and internal operating procedure when it is promulgated or amended.

  * (2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.


* (b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW. A court of appeals may regulate practice in a particular case in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and local rules of the circuit. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local circuit rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.

### Rule 48. Masters
* (a) APPOINTMENT; POWERS. A court of appeals may appoint a special master to hold hearings, if necessary, and to recommend factual findings and disposition in matters ancillary to proceedings in the court. Unless the order referring a matter to a master specifies or limits the master's powers, those powers include, but are not limited to, the following:

  * (1) regulating all aspects of a hearing;

  * (2) taking all appropriate action for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order;

  * (3) requiring the production of evidence on all matters embraced in the reference; and

  * (4) administering oaths and examining witnesses and parties.


* (b) COMPENSATION. If the master is not a judge or court employee, the court must determine the master's compensation and whether the cost is to be charged to any party.
