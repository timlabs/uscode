### TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

### Rule 26. Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery
* (a) REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.

  * (1) _Initial Disclosure._

    * (A) _In General._ Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:

      * (i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;

      * (ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;

      * (iii) a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party—who must also make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and

      * (iv) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34, any insurance agreement under which an insurance business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.


    * (B) _Proceedings Exempt from Initial Disclosure._ The following proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure:

      * (i) an action for review on an administrative record;

      * (ii) a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal statute;

      * (iii) a petition for habeas corpus or any other proceeding to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence;

      * (iv) an action brought without an attorney by a person in the custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision;

      * (v) an action to enforce or quash an administrative summons or subpoena;

      * (vi) an action by the United States to recover benefit payments;

      * (vii) an action by the United States to collect on a student loan guaranteed by the United States;

      * (viii) a proceeding ancillary to a proceeding in another court; and

      * (ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award.


    * (C) _Time for Initial Disclosures—In General._ A party must make the initial disclosures at or within 14 days after the parties' Rule 26(f) conference unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the conference that initial disclosures are not appropriate in this action and states the objection in the proposed discovery plan. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure.

    * (D) _Time for Initial Disclosures—For Parties Served or Joined Later._ A party that is first served or otherwise joined after the Rule 26(f) conference must make the initial disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order.

    * (E) _Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses._ A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it. A party is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.


  * (2) _Disclosure of Expert Testimony._

    * (A) _In General._ In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.

    * (B) _Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:

      * (i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them;

      * (ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;

      * (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them;

      * (iv) the witness's qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years;

      * (v) a list of all other cases in which, during the previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and

      * (vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case.


    * (C) _Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must state:

      * (i) the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705; and

      * (ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.


    * (D) _Time to Disclose Expert Testimony._ A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made:

      * (i) at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial; or

      * (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within 30 days after the other party's disclosure.


    * (E) _Supplementing the Disclosure._ The parties must supplement these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).


  * (3) _Pretrial Disclosures._

    * (A) _In General._ In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other parties and promptly file the following information about the evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for impeachment:

      * (i) the name and, if not previously provided, the address and telephone number of each witness—separately identifying those the party expects to present and those it may call if the need arises;

      * (ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony the party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the pertinent parts of the deposition; and

      * (iii) an identification of each document or other exhibit, including summaries of other evidence—separately identifying those items the party expects to offer and those it may offer if the need arises.


    * (B) _Time for Pretrial Disclosures; Objections._ Unless the court orders otherwise, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial. Within 14 days after they are made, unless the court sets a different time, a party may serve and promptly file a list of the following objections: any objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition designated by another party under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(ii); and any objection, together with the grounds for it, that may be made to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(iii). An objection not so made—except for one under Federal Rule of Evidence 402 or 403—is waived unless excused by the court for good cause.


  * (4) _Form of Disclosures._ Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under Rule 26(a) must be in writing, signed, and served.


* (b) DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS.

  * (1) _Scope in General._ Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.

  * (2) _Limitations on Frequency and Extent._

    * (A) _When Permitted._ By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or on the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order or local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests under Rule 36.

    * (B) _Specific Limitations on Electronically Stored Information._ A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

    * (C) _When Required._ On motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by local rule if it determines that:

      * (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

      * (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or

      * (iii) the proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).


  * (3) _Trial Preparation: Materials._

    * (A) _Documents and Tangible Things._ Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent). But, subject to Rule 26(b)(4), those materials may be discovered if:

      * (i) they are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1); and

      * (ii) the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.


    * (B) _Protection Against Disclosure._ If the court orders discovery of those materials, it must protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party's attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.

    * (C) _Previous Statement._ Any party or other person may, on request and without the required showing, obtain the person's own previous statement about the action or its subject matter. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order, and Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses. A previous statement is either:

      * (i) a written statement that the person has signed or otherwise adopted or approved; or

      * (ii) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording—or a transcription of it—that recites substantially verbatim the person's oral statement.


  * (4) _Trial Preparation: Experts._

    * (A) _Deposition of an Expert Who May Testify._ A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires a report from the expert, the deposition may be conducted only after the report is provided.

    * (B) _Trial-Preparation Protection for Draft Reports or Disclosures._ Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect drafts of any report or disclosure required under Rule 26(a)(2), regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.

    * (C) _Trial-Preparation Protection for Communications Between a Party's Attorney and Expert Witnesses._ Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect communications between the party's attorney and any witness required to provide a report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), regardless of the form of the communications, except to the extent that the communications:

      * (i) relate to compensation for the expert's study or testimony;

      * (ii) identify facts or data that the party's attorney provided and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or

      * (iii) identify assumptions that the party's attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.


    * (D) _Expert Employed Only for Trial Preparation._ Ordinarily, a party may not, by interrogatories or deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial. But a party may do so only:

      * (i) as provided in Rule 35(b); or

      * (ii) on showing exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.


    * (E) _Payment._ Unless manifest injustice would result, the court must require that the party seeking discovery:

      * (i) pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under Rule 26(b)(4)(A) or (D); and

      * (ii) for discovery under (D), also pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses it reasonably incurred in obtaining the expert's facts and opinions.


  * (5) _Claiming Privilege or Protecting Trial-Preparation Materials._

    * (A) _Information Withheld._ When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material, the party must:

      * (i) expressly make the claim; and

      * (ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed—and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.


    * (B) _Information Produced._ If information produced in discovery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the party making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.


* (c) PROTECTIVE ORDERS.

  * (1) _In General._ A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court where the action is pending—or as an alternative on matters relating to a deposition, in the court for the district where the deposition will be taken. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:

    * (A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery;

    * (B) specifying terms, including time and place or the allocation of expenses, for the disclosure or discovery;

    * (C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking discovery;

    * (D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;

    * (E) designating the persons who may be present while the discovery is conducted;

    * (F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on court order;

    * (G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way; and

    * (H) requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the court directs.


  * (2) _Ordering Discovery._ If a motion for a protective order is wholly or partly denied, the court may, on just terms, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.

  * (3) _Awarding Expenses._ Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses.


* (d) TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DISCOVERY.

  * (1) _Timing._ A party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by stipulation, or by court order.

  * (2) _Early Rule 34 Requests._

    * (A) _Time to Deliver._ More than 21 days after the summons and complaint are served on a party, a request under Rule 34 may be delivered:

      * (i) to that party by any other party, and

      * (ii) by that party to any plaintiff or to any other party that has been served.


    * (B) _When Considered Served._ The request is considered to have been served at the first Rule 26(f) conference.


  * (3) _Sequence._ Unless the parties stipulate or the court orders otherwise for the parties' and witnesses' convenience and in the interests of justice:

    * (A) methods of discovery may be used in any sequence; and

    * (B) discovery by one party does not require any other party to delay its discovery.


* (e) SUPPLEMENTING DISCLOSURES AND RESPONSES.

  * (1) _In General._ A party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission—must supplement or correct its disclosure or response:

    * (A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing; or

    * (B) as ordered by the court.


  * (2) _Expert Witness._ For an expert whose report must be disclosed under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), the party's duty to supplement extends both to information included in the report and to information given during the expert's deposition. Any additions or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time the party's pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.


* (f) CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES; PLANNING FOR DISCOVERY.

  * (1) _Conference Timing._ Except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or when the court orders otherwise, the parties must confer as soon as practicable—and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b).

  * (2) _Conference Content; Parties' Responsibilities._ In conferring, the parties must consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case; make or arrange for the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1); discuss any issues about preserving discoverable information; and develop a proposed discovery plan. The attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties that have appeared in the case are jointly responsible for arranging the conference, for attempting in good faith to agree on the proposed discovery plan, and for submitting to the court within 14 days after the conference a written report outlining the plan. The court may order the parties or attorneys to attend the conference in person.

  * (3) _Discovery Plan._ A discovery plan must state the parties' views and proposals on:

    * (A) what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement for disclosures under Rule 26(a), including a statement of when initial disclosures were made or will be made;

    * (B) the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused on particular issues;

    * (C) any issues about disclosure, discovery, or preservation of electronically stored information, including the form or forms in which it should be produced;

    * (D) any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials, including—if the parties agree on a procedure to assert these claims after production—whether to ask the court to include their agreement in an order under Federal Rule of Evidence 502;

    * (E) what changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed; and

    * (F) any other orders that the court should issue under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c).


  * (4) _Expedited Schedule._ If necessary to comply with its expedited schedule for Rule 16(b) conferences, a court may by local rule:

    * (A) require the parties' conference to occur less than 21 days before the scheduling conference is held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b); and

    * (B) require the written report outlining the discovery plan to be filed less than 14 days after the parties' conference, or excuse the parties from submitting a written report and permit them to report orally on their discovery plan at the Rule 16(b) conference.


* (g) SIGNING DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY REQUESTS, RESPONSES, AND OBJECTIONS.

  * (1) _Signature Required; Effect of Signature._ Every disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) or (a)(3) and every discovery request, response, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's own name—or by the party personally, if unrepresented—and must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. By signing, an attorney or party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry:

    * (A) with respect to a disclosure, it is complete and correct as of the time it is made; and

    * (B) with respect to a discovery request, response, or objection, it is:

      * (i) consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law;

      * (ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and

      * (iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.


  * (2) _Failure to Sign._ Other parties have no duty to act on an unsigned disclosure, request, response, or objection until it is signed, and the court must strike it unless a signature is promptly supplied after the omission is called to the attorney's or party's attention.

  * (3) _Sanction for Improper Certification._ If a certification violates this rule without substantial justification, the court, on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or both. The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the violation.

### Rule 27. Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony
* (a) BEFORE AN ACTION IS FILED.

  * (1) _Petition._ A person who wants to perpetuate testimony about any matter cognizable in a United States court may file a verified petition in the district court for the district where any expected adverse party resides. The petition must ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to depose the named persons in order to perpetuate their testimony. The petition must be titled in the petitioner's name and must show:

    * (A) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in a United States court but cannot presently bring it or cause it to be brought;

    * (B) the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest;

    * (C) the facts that the petitioner wants to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons to perpetuate it;

    * (D) the names or a description of the persons whom the petitioner expects to be adverse parties and their addresses, so far as known; and

    * (E) the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent.


  * (2) _Notice and Service._ At least 21 days before the hearing date, the petitioner must serve each expected adverse party with a copy of the petition and a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. The notice may be served either inside or outside the district or state in the manner provided in Rule 4. If that service cannot be made with reasonable diligence on an expected adverse party, the court may order service by publication or otherwise. The court must appoint an attorney to represent persons not served in the manner provided in Rule 4 and to cross-examine the deponent if an unserved person is not otherwise represented. If any expected adverse party is a minor or is incompetent, Rule 17(c) applies.

  * (3) _Order and Examination._ If satisfied that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court must issue an order that designates or describes the persons whose depositions may be taken, specifies the subject matter of the examinations, and states whether the depositions will be taken orally or by written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken under these rules, and the court may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. A reference in these rules to the court where an action is pending means, for purposes of this rule, the court where the petition for the deposition was filed.

  * (4) _Using the Deposition._ A deposition to perpetuate testimony may be used under Rule 32(a) in any later-filed district-court action involving the same subject matter if the deposition either was taken under these rules or, although not so taken, would be admissible in evidence in the courts of the state where it was taken.


* (b) PENDING APPEAL.

  * (1) _In General._ The court where a judgment has been rendered may, if an appeal has been taken or may still be taken, permit a party to depose witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in that court.

  * (2) _Motion._ The party who wants to perpetuate testimony may move for leave to take the depositions, on the same notice and service as if the action were pending in the district court. The motion must show:

    * (A) the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent; and

    * (B) the reasons for perpetuating the testimony.


  * (3) _Court Order._ If the court finds that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court may permit the depositions to be taken and may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. The depositions may be taken and used as any other deposition taken in a pending district-court action.


* (c) PERPETUATION BY AN ACTION. This rule does not limit a court's power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.

### Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken
* (a) WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

  * (1) _In General._ Within the United States or a territory or insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a deposition must be taken before:

    * (A) an officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or

    * (B) a person appointed by the court where the action is pending to administer oaths and take testimony.


  * (2) _Definition of "Officer."_ The term "officer" in Rules 30, 31, and 32 includes a person appointed by the court under this rule or designated by the parties under Rule 29(a).


* (b) IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

  * (1) _In General._ A deposition may be taken in a foreign country:

    * (A) under an applicable treaty or convention;

    * (B) under a letter of request, whether or not captioned a "letter rogatory";

    * (C) on notice, before a person authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or

    * (D) before a person commissioned by the court to administer any necessary oath and take testimony.


  * (2) _Issuing a Letter of Request or a Commission._ A letter of request, a commission, or both may be issued:

    * (A) on appropriate terms after an application and notice of it; and

    * (B) without a showing that taking the deposition in another manner is impracticable or inconvenient.


  * (3) _Form of a Request, Notice, or Commission._ When a letter of request or any other device is used according to a treaty or convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. A letter of request may be addressed "To the Appropriate Authority in [name of country]." A deposition notice or a commission must designate by name or descriptive title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.

  * (4) _Letter of Request—Admitting Evidence._ Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States.


* (c) DISQUALIFICATION. A deposition must not be taken before a person who is any party's relative, employee, or attorney; who is related to or employed by any party's attorney; or who is financially interested in the action.

### Rule 29. Stipulations About Discovery Procedure
* Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate that:

  * (a) a deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified—in which event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and

  * (b) other procedures governing or limiting discovery be modified—but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery must have court approval if it would interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for trial.

### Rule 30. Depositions by Oral Examination
* (a) WHEN A DEPOSITION MAY BE TAKEN.

  * (1) _Without Leave._ A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 30(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.

  * (2) _With Leave._ A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2):

    * (A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:

      * (i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions being taken under this rule or Rule 31 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;

      * (ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or

      * (iii) the party seeks to take the deposition before the time specified in Rule 26(d), unless the party certifies in the notice, with supporting facts, that the deponent is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country after that time; or


    * (B) if the deponent is confined in prison.


* (b) NOTICE OF THE DEPOSITION; OTHER FORMAL REQUIREMENTS.

  * (1) _Notice in General._ A party who wants to depose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent's name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs.

  * (2) _Producing Documents._ If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the deponent, the materials designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request under Rule 34 to produce documents and tangible things at the deposition.

  * (3) _Method of Recording._

    * (A) _Method Stated in the Notice._ The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.

    * (B) _Additional Method._ With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.


  * (4) _By Remote Means._ The parties may stipulate—or the court may on motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.

  * (5) _Officer's Duties._

    * (A) _Before the Deposition._ Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under Rule 28. The officer must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:

      * (i) the officer's name and business address;

      * (ii) the date, time, and place of the deposition;

      * (iii) the deponent's name;

      * (iv) the officer's administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and

      * (v) the identity of all persons present.


    * (B) _Conducting the Deposition; Avoiding Distortion._ If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)–(iii) at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.

    * (C) _After the Deposition._ At the end of a deposition, the officer must state on the record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.


* (6) _Notice or Subpoena Directed to an Organization._ In its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. Before or promptly after the notice or subpoena is served, the serving party and the organization must confer in good faith about the matters for examination. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to confer with the serving party and to designate each person who will testify. The persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.


* (c) EXAMINATION AND CROSS-EXAMINATION; RECORD OF THE EXAMINATION; OBJECTIONS; WRITTEN QUESTIONS.

  * (1) _Examination and Cross-Examination._ The examination and cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, except Rules 103 and 615. After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the officer must record the testimony by the method designated under Rule 30(b)(3)(A). The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.

  * (2) _Objections._ An objection at the time of the examination—whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).

  * (3) _Participating Through Written Questions._ Instead of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers verbatim.


* (d) DURATION; SANCTION; MOTION TO TERMINATE OR LIMIT.

  * (1) _Duration._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a deposition is limited to one day of 7 hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2) if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.

  * (2) _Sanction._ The court may impose an appropriate sanction—including the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred by any party—on a person who impedes, delays, or frustrates the fair examination of the deponent.

  * (3) _Motion to Terminate or Limit._

    * (A) _Grounds._ At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.

    * (B) _Order._ The court may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope and manner as provided in Rule 26(c). If terminated, the deposition may be resumed only by order of the court where the action is pending.

    * (C) _Award of Expenses._ Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses.


* (e) REVIEW BY THE WITNESS; CHANGES.

  * (1) _Review; Statement of Changes._ On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is completed, the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which:

    * (A) to review the transcript or recording; and

    * (B) if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.


  * (2) _Changes Indicated in the Officer's Certificate._ The officer must note in the certificate prescribed by Rule 30(f)(1) whether a review was requested and, if so, must attach any changes the deponent makes during the 30-day period.


* (f) CERTIFICATION AND DELIVERY; EXHIBITS; COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPT OR RECORDING; FILING.

  * (1) _Certification and Delivery._ The officer must certify in writing that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness's testimony. The certificate must accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the court orders otherwise, the officer must seal the deposition in an envelope or package bearing the title of the action and marked "Deposition of [witness's name]" and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.

  * (2) _Documents and Tangible Things._

    * (A) _Originals and Copies._ Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a party's request, be marked for identification and attached to the deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them wants to keep the originals, the person may:

      * (i) offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition, and then used as originals—after giving all parties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparing them with the originals; or

      * (ii) give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are marked—in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.


    * (B) _Order Regarding the Originals._ Any party may move for an order that the originals be attached to the deposition pending final disposition of the case.


  * (3) _Copies of the Transcript or Recording._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, the officer must retain the stenographic notes of a deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another method. When paid reasonable charges, the officer must furnish a copy of the transcript or recording to any party or the deponent.

  * (4) _Notice of Filing._ A party who files the deposition must promptly notify all other parties of the filing.


* (g) FAILURE TO ATTEND A DEPOSITION OR SERVE A SUBPOENA; EXPENSES. A party who, expecting a deposition to be taken, attends in person or by an attorney may recover reasonable expenses for attending, including attorney's fees, if the noticing party failed to:

  * (1) attend and proceed with the deposition; or

  * (2) serve a subpoena on a nonparty deponent, who consequently did not attend.

### Rule 31. Depositions by Written Questions
* (a) WHEN A DEPOSITION MAY BE TAKEN.

  * (1) _Without Leave._ A party may, by written questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 31(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.

  * (2) _With Leave._ A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2):

    * (A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:

      * (i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions being taken under this rule or Rule 30 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;

      * (ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or

      * (iii) the party seeks to take a deposition before the time specified in Rule 26(d); or


    * (B) if the deponent is confined in prison.


  * (3) _Service; Required Notice._ A party who wants to depose a person by written questions must serve them on every other party, with a notice stating, if known, the deponent's name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. The notice must also state the name or descriptive title and the address of the officer before whom the deposition will be taken.

  * (4) _Questions Directed to an Organization._ A public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency may be deposed by written questions in accordance with Rule 30(b)(6).

  * (5) _Questions from Other Parties._ Any questions to the deponent from other parties must be served on all parties as follows: cross-questions, within 14 days after being served with the notice and direct questions; redirect questions, within 7 days after being served with cross-questions; and recross-questions, within 7 days after being served with redirect questions. The court may, for good cause, extend or shorten these times.


* (b) DELIVERY TO THE OFFICER; OFFICER'S DUTIES. The party who noticed the deposition must deliver to the officer a copy of all the questions served and of the notice. The officer must promptly proceed in the manner provided in Rule 30(c), (e), and (f) to:

  * (1) take the deponent's testimony in response to the questions;

  * (2) prepare and certify the deposition; and

  * (3) send it to the party, attaching a copy of the questions and of the notice.


* (c) NOTICE OF COMPLETION OR FILING.

  * (1) _Completion._ The party who noticed the deposition must notify all other parties when it is completed.

  * (2) _Filing._ A party who files the deposition must promptly notify all other parties of the filing.

### Rule 32. Using Depositions in Court Proceedings
* (a) USING DEPOSITIONS.

  * (1) _In General._ At a hearing or trial, all or part of a deposition may be used against a party on these conditions:

    * (A) the party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or had reasonable notice of it;

    * (B) it is used to the extent it would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence if the deponent were present and testifying; and

    * (C) the use is allowed by Rule 32(a)(2) through (8).


  * (2) _Impeachment and Other Uses._ Any party may use a deposition to contradict or impeach the testimony given by the deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

  * (3) _Deposition of Party, Agent, or Designee._ An adverse party may use for any purpose the deposition of a party or anyone who, when deposed, was the party's officer, director, managing agent, or designee under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4).

  * (4) _Unavailable Witness._ A party may use for any purpose the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the court finds:

    * (A) that the witness is dead;

    * (B) that the witness is more than 100 miles from the place of hearing or trial or is outside the United States, unless it appears that the witness's absence was procured by the party offering the deposition;

    * (C) that the witness cannot attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;

    * (D) that the party offering the deposition could not procure the witness's attendance by subpoena; or

    * (E) on motion and notice, that exceptional circumstances make it desirable—in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of live testimony in open court—to permit the deposition to be used.


  * (5) _Limitations on Use._

    * (A) _Deposition Taken on Short Notice._ A deposition must not be used against a party who, having received less than 14 days' notice of the deposition, promptly moved for a protective order under Rule 26(c)(1)(B) requesting that it not be taken or be taken at a different time or place—and this motion was still pending when the deposition was taken.

    * (B) _Unavailable Deponent; Party Could Not Obtain an Attorney._ A deposition taken without leave of court under the unavailability provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(iii) must not be used against a party who shows that, when served with the notice, it could not, despite diligent efforts, obtain an attorney to represent it at the deposition.


  * (6) _Using Part of a Deposition._ If a party offers in evidence only part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce other parts that in fairness should be considered with the part introduced, and any party may itself introduce any other parts.

  * (7) _Substituting a Party._ Substituting a party under Rule 25 does not affect the right to use a deposition previously taken.

  * (8) _Deposition Taken in an Earlier Action._ A deposition lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or state-court action may be used in a later action involving the same subject matter between the same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the later action. A deposition previously taken may also be used as allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.


* (b) OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY. Subject to Rules 28(b) and 32(d)(3), an objection may be made at a hearing or trial to the admission of any deposition testimony that would be inadmissible if the witness were present and testifying.

* (c) FORM OF PRESENTATION. Unless the court orders otherwise, a party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony the party offers, but may provide the court with the testimony in nontranscript form as well. On any party's request, deposition testimony offered in a jury trial for any purpose other than impeachment must be presented in nontranscript form, if available, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.

* (d) WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS.

  * (1) _To the Notice._ An objection to an error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served in writing on the party giving the notice.

  * (2) _To the Officer's Qualification._ An objection based on disqualification of the officer before whom a deposition is to be taken is waived if not made:

    * (A) before the deposition begins; or

    * (B) promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.


  * (3) _To the Taking of the Deposition._

    * (A) _Objection to Competence, Relevance, or Materiality._ An objection to a deponent's competence—or to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony—is not waived by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.

    * (B) _Objection to an Error or Irregularity._ An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:

      * (i) it relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a question or answer, the oath or affirmation, a party's conduct, or other matters that might have been corrected at that time; and

      * (ii) it is not timely made during the deposition.


    * (C) _Objection to a Written Question._ An objection to the form of a written question under Rule 31 is waived if not served in writing on the party submitting the question within the time for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a recross-question, within 7 days after being served with it.


  * (4) _To Completing and Returning the Deposition._ An objection to how the officer transcribed the testimony—or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition—is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

### Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Number._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 written interrogatories, including all discrete subparts. Leave to serve additional interrogatories may be granted to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2).

  * (2) _Scope._ An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b). An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time.


* (b) ANSWERS AND OBJECTIONS.

  * (1) _Responding Party._ The interrogatories must be answered:

    * (A) by the party to whom they are directed; or

    * (B) if that party is a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who must furnish the information available to the party.


  * (2) _Time to Respond._ The responding party must serve its answers and any objections within 30 days after being served with the interrogatories. A shorter or longer time may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.

  * (3) _Answering Each Interrogatory._ Each interrogatory must, to the extent it is not objected to, be answered separately and fully in writing under oath.

  * (4) _Objections._ The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for good cause, excuses the failure.

  * (5) _Signature._ The person who makes the answers must sign them, and the attorney who objects must sign any objections.


* (c) USE. An answer to an interrogatory may be used to the extent allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

* (d) OPTION TO PRODUCE BUSINESS RECORDS. If the answer to an interrogatory may be determined by examining, auditing, compiling, abstracting, or summarizing a party's business records (including electronically stored information), and if the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer will be substantially the same for either party, the responding party may answer by:

  * (1) specifying the records that must be reviewed, in sufficient detail to enable the interrogating party to locate and identify them as readily as the responding party could; and

  * (2) giving the interrogating party a reasonable opportunity to examine and audit the records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries.

### Rule 34. Producing Documents, Electronically Stored Information, and Tangible Things, or Entering onto Land, for Inspection and Other Purposes
* (a) IN GENERAL. A party may serve on any other party a request within the scope of Rule 26(b):

  * (1) to produce and permit the requesting party or its representative to inspect, copy, test, or sample the following items in the responding party's possession, custody, or control:

    * (A) any designated documents or electronically stored information—including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations—stored in any medium from which information can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation by the responding party into a reasonably usable form; or

    * (B) any designated tangible things; or


  * (2) to permit entry onto designated land or other property possessed or controlled by the responding party, so that the requesting party may inspect, measure, survey, photograph, test, or sample the property or any designated object or operation on it.


* (b) PROCEDURE.

  * (1) _Contents of the Request._ The request:

    * (A) must describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be inspected;

    * (B) must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection and for performing the related acts; and

    * (C) may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.


  * (2) _Responses and Objections._

    * (A) _Time to Respond._ The party to whom the request is directed must respond in writing within 30 days after being served or—if the request was delivered under Rule 26(d)(2)—within 30 days after the parties' first Rule 26(f) conference. A shorter or longer time may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.

    * (B) _Responding to Each Item._ For each item or category, the response must either state that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested or state with specificity the grounds for objecting to the request, including the reasons. The responding party may state that it will produce copies of documents or of electronically stored information instead of permitting inspection. The production must then be completed no later than the time for inspection specified in the request or another reasonable time specified in the response.

    * (C) _Objections._ An objection must state whether any responsive materials are being withheld on the basis of that objection. An objection to part of a request must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest.

    * (D) _Responding to a Request for Production of Electronically Stored Information._ The response may state an objection to a requested form for producing electronically stored information. If the responding party objects to a requested form—or if no form was specified in the request—the party must state the form or forms it intends to use.

    * (E) _Producing the Documents or Electronically Stored Information._ Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, these procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:

      * (i) A party must produce documents as they are kept in the usual course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the request;

      * (ii) If a request does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, a party must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms; and

      * (iii) A party need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.


* (c) NONPARTIES. As provided in Rule 45, a nonparty may be compelled to produce documents and tangible things or to permit an inspection.

### Rule 35. Physical and Mental Examinations
* (a) ORDER FOR AN EXAMINATION.

  * (1) _In General._ The court where the action is pending may order a party whose mental or physical condition—including blood group—is in controversy to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner. The court has the same authority to order a party to produce for examination a person who is in its custody or under its legal control.

  * (2) _Motion and Notice; Contents of the Order._ The order:

    * (A) may be made only on motion for good cause and on notice to all parties and the person to be examined; and

    * (B) must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination, as well as the person or persons who will perform it.


* (b) EXAMINER'S REPORT.

  * (1) _Request by the Party or Person Examined._ The party who moved for the examination must, on request, deliver to the requester a copy of the examiner's report, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. The request may be made by the party against whom the examination order was issued or by the person examined.

  * (2) _Contents._ The examiner's report must be in writing and must set out in detail the examiner's findings, including diagnoses, conclusions, and the results of any tests.

  * (3) _Request by the Moving Party._ After delivering the reports, the party who moved for the examination may request—and is entitled to receive—from the party against whom the examination order was issued like reports of all earlier or later examinations of the same condition. But those reports need not be delivered by the party with custody or control of the person examined if the party shows that it could not obtain them.

  * (4) _Waiver of Privilege._ By requesting and obtaining the examiner's report, or by deposing the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege it may have—in that action or any other action involving the same controversy—concerning testimony about all examinations of the same condition.

  * (5) _Failure to Deliver a Report._ The court on motion may order—on just terms—that a party deliver the report of an examination. If the report is not provided, the court may exclude the examiner's testimony at trial.

  * (6) _Scope._ This subdivision (b) applies also to an examination made by the parties' agreement, unless the agreement states otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude obtaining an examiner's report or deposing an examiner under other rules.

### Rule 36. Requests for Admission
* (a) SCOPE AND PROCEDURE.

  * (1) _Scope._ A party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to:

    * (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and

    * (B) the genuineness of any described documents.


  * (2) _Form; Copy of a Document._ Each matter must be separately stated. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.

  * (3) _Time to Respond; Effect of Not Responding._ A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.

  * (4) _Answer._ If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.

  * (5) _Objections._ The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial.

  * (6) _Motion Regarding the Sufficiency of an Answer or Objection._ The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless the court finds an objection justified, it must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the court may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may defer its final decision until a pretrial conference or a specified time before trial. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to an award of expenses.


* (b) EFFECT OF AN ADMISSION; WITHDRAWING OR AMENDING IT. A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. Subject to Rule 16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.

### Rule 37. Failure to Make Disclosures or to Cooperate in Discovery; Sanctions
* (a) MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING DISCLOSURE OR DISCOVERY.

  * (1) _In General._ On notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort to obtain it without court action.

  * (2) _Appropriate Court._ A motion for an order to a party must be made in the court where the action is pending. A motion for an order to a nonparty must be made in the court where the discovery is or will be taken.

  * (3) _Specific Motions._

    * (A) _To Compel Disclosure._ If a party fails to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions.

    * (B) _To Compel a Discovery Response._ A party seeking discovery may move for an order compelling an answer, designation, production, or inspection. This motion may be made if:

      * (i) a deponent fails to answer a question asked under Rule 30 or 31;

      * (ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4);

      * (iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33; or

      * (iv) a party fails to produce documents or fails to respond that inspection will be permitted—or fails to permit inspection—as requested under Rule 34.


    * (C) _Related to a Deposition._ When taking an oral deposition, the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the examination before moving for an order.


  * (4) _Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response._ For purposes of this subdivision (a), an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.

  * (5) _Payment of Expenses; Protective Orders._

    * (A) _If the Motion Is Granted (or Disclosure or Discovery Is Provided After Filing)._ If the motion is granted—or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed—the court must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant's reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees. But the court must not order this payment if:

      * (i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action;

      * (ii) the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified; or

      * (iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.


    * (B) _If the Motion Is Denied._ If the motion is denied, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to pay the party or deponent who opposed the motion its reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's fees. But the court must not order this payment if the motion was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

    * (C) _If the Motion Is Granted in Part and Denied in Part._ If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses for the motion.


* (b) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A COURT ORDER.

  * (1) _Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Deposition Is Taken._ If the court where the discovery is taken orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of court. If a deposition-related motion is transferred to the court where the action is pending, and that court orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of either the court where the discovery is taken or the court where the action is pending.

  * (2) _Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Action Is Pending._

    * (A) _For Not Obeying a Discovery Order._ If a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent—or a witness designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders. They may include the following:

      * (i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;

      * (ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence;

      * (iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part;

      * (iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;

      * (v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part;

      * (vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; or

      * (vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.


    * (B) _For Not Producing a Person for Examination._ If a party fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to produce another person for examination, the court may issue any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi), unless the disobedient party shows that it cannot produce the other person.

    * (C) _Payment of Expenses._ Instead of or in addition to the orders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.


* (c) FAILURE TO DISCLOSE, TO SUPPLEMENT AN EARLIER RESPONSE, OR TO ADMIT.

  * (1) _Failure to Disclose or Supplement._ If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:

    * (A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure;

    * (B) may inform the jury of the party's failure; and

    * (C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi).


  * (2) _Failure to Admit._ If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the matter true, the requesting party may move that the party who failed to admit pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in making that proof. The court must so order unless:

    * (A) the request was held objectionable under Rule 36(a);

    * (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance;

    * (C) the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground to believe that it might prevail on the matter; or

    * (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.


* (d) PARTY'S FAILURE TO ATTEND ITS OWN DEPOSITION, SERVE ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES, OR RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR INSPECTION.

  * (1) _In General._

    * (A) _Motion; Grounds for Sanctions._ The court where the action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if:

      * (i) a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent—or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails, after being served with proper notice, to appear for that person's deposition; or

      * (ii) a party, after being properly served with interrogatories under Rule 33 or a request for inspection under Rule 34, fails to serve its answers, objections, or written response.


    * (B) _Certification._ A motion for sanctions for failing to answer or respond must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to act in an effort to obtain the answer or response without court action.


  * (2) _Unacceptable Excuse for Failing to Act._ A failure described in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground that the discovery sought was objectionable, unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c).

  * (3) _Types of Sanctions._ Sanctions may include any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi). Instead of or in addition to these sanctions, the court must require the party failing to act, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.


* (e) FAILURE TO PRESERVE ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION. If electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:

  * (1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or

  * (2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation may:

    * (A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;

    * (B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or

    * (C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment.


* (f) FAILURE TO PARTICIPATE IN FRAMING A DISCOVERY PLAN. If a party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in developing and submitting a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require that party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.
