### ARTICLE X. CONTENTS OF WRITINGS, RECORDINGS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS

### Rule 1001. Definitions That Apply to This Article
* In this article:

  * (a) A "writing" consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent set down in any form.

  * (b) A "recording" consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent recorded in any manner.

  * (c) A "photograph" means a photographic image or its equivalent stored in any form.

  * (d) An "original" of a writing or recording means the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, "original" means any printout—or other output readable by sight—if it accurately reflects the information. An "original" of a photograph includes the negative or a print from it.

  * (e) A "duplicate" means a counterpart produced by a mechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique that accurately reproduces the original.

### Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original
* An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.

### Rule 1003. Admissibility of Duplicates
* A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a genuine question is raised about the original's authenticity or the circumstances make it unfair to admit the duplicate.

### Rule 1004. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Content
* An original is not required and other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph is admissible if:

  * (a) all the originals are lost or destroyed, and not by the proponent acting in bad faith;

  * (b) an original cannot be obtained by any available judicial process;

  * (c) the party against whom the original would be offered had control of the original; was at that time put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the original would be a subject of proof at the trial or hearing; and fails to produce it at the trial or hearing; or

  * (d) the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.

### Rule 1005. Copies of Public Records to Prove Content
* The proponent may use a copy to prove the content of an official record—or of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law—if these conditions are met: the record or document is otherwise admissible; and the copy is certified as correct in accordance with Rule 902(4) or is testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If no such copy can be obtained by reasonable diligence, then the proponent may use other evidence to prove the content.

### Rule 1006. Summaries to Prove Content
* The proponent may use a summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court. The proponent must make the originals or duplicates available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and place. And the court may order the proponent to produce them in court.

### Rule 1007. Testimony or Statement of a Party to Prove Content
* The proponent may prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph by the testimony, deposition, or written statement of the party against whom the evidence is offered. The proponent need not account for the original.

### Rule 1008. Functions of the Court and Jury
* Ordinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual conditions for admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under Rule 1004 or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines—in accordance with Rule 104(b)—any issue about whether:

  * (a) an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;

  * (b) another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or

  * (c) other evidence of content accurately reflects the content.
