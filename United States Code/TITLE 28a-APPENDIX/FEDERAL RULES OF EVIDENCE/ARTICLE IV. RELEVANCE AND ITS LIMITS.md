### ARTICLE IV. RELEVANCE AND ITS LIMITS

### Rule 401. Test for Relevant Evidence
* Evidence is relevant if:

  * (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and

  * (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.

### Rule 402. General Admissibility of Relevant Evidence
* Relevant evidence is admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise:

  * • the United States Constitution;

  * • a federal statute;

  * • these rules; or

  * • other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.


* Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.

### Rule 403. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste of Time, or Other Reasons
* The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.

### Rule 404. Character Evidence; Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.
* (a) CHARACTER EVIDENCE.

  * (1) _Prohibited Uses._ Evidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.

  * (2) _Exceptions for a Defendant or Victim in a Criminal Case._ The following exceptions apply in a criminal case:

    * (A) a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant's pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it;

    * (B) subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant may offer evidence of an alleged victim's pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may:

      * (i) offer evidence to rebut it; and

      * (ii) offer evidence of the defendant's same trait; and


    * (C) in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim's trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.


  * (3) _Exceptions for a Witness._ Evidence of a witness's character may be admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609.


* (b) OTHER CRIMES, WRONGS, OR ACTS.

  * (2) _Permitted Uses._ This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

  * (3) _Notice in a Criminal Case._ In a criminal case, the prosecutor must:

    * (A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;

    * (B) articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and

    * (C) do so in writing before trial—or in any form during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.

### Rule 405. Methods of Proving Character
* (a) BY REPUTATION OR OPINION. When evidence of a person's character or character trait is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person's reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination of the character witness, the court may allow an inquiry into relevant specific instances of the person's conduct.

* (b) BY SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF CONDUCT. When a person's character or character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved by relevant specific instances of the person's conduct.

### Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice
* Evidence of a person's habit or an organization's routine practice may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the person or organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice. The court may admit this evidence regardless of whether it is corroborated or whether there was an eyewitness.

### Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures
* When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:

  * • negligence;

  * • culpable conduct;

  * • a defect in a product or its design; or

  * • a need for a warning or instruction.


* But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or—if disputed—proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.

### Rule 408. Compromise Offers and Negotiations
* (a) PROHIBITED USES. Evidence of the following is not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:

  * (1) furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept—a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and

  * (2) conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the claim—except when offered in a criminal case and when the negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.


* (b) EXCEPTIONS. The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving a witness's bias or prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.

### Rule 409. Offers to Pay Medical and Similar Expenses
* Evidence of furnishing, promising to pay, or offering to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses resulting from an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.

### Rule 410. Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements

  * (3) a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 or a comparable state procedure; or

  * (4) a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-withdrawn guilty plea.


* (b) EXCEPTIONS. The court may admit a statement described in Rule 410(a)(3) or (4):

  * (1) in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if in fairness the statements ought to be considered together; or

  * (2) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement, if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.

### Rule 411. Liability Insurance
* Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving a witness's bias or prejudice or proving agency, ownership, or control.

### Rule 412. Sex-Offense Cases: The Victim's Sexual Behavior or Predisposition
* (a) PROHIBITED USES. The following evidence is not admissible in a civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct:

  * (1) evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior; or

* (b) EXCEPTIONS.

  * (1) _Criminal Cases._ The court may admit the following evidence in a criminal case:

    * (A) evidence of specific instances of a victim's sexual behavior, if offered to prove that someone other than the defendant was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence;

    * (B) evidence of specific instances of a victim's sexual behavior with respect to the person accused of the sexual misconduct, if offered by the defendant to prove consent or if offered by the prosecutor; and

    * (C) evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's constitutional rights.


  * (2) _Civil Cases._ In a civil case, the court may admit evidence offered to prove a victim's sexual behavior or sexual predisposition if its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party. The court may admit evidence of a victim's reputation only if the victim has placed it in controversy.


* (c) PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE ADMISSIBILITY.

  * (1) _Motion._ If a party intends to offer evidence under Rule 412(b), the party must:

    * (D) notify the victim or, when appropriate, the victim's guardian or representative.


  * (2) _Hearing._ Before admitting evidence under this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion, related materials, and the record of the hearing must be and remain sealed.
