### ARTICLE IX. AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION

### Rule 901. Authenticating or Identifying Evidence
* (a) IN GENERAL. To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.

* (b) EXAMPLES. The following are examples only—not a complete list—of evidence that satisfies the requirement:

  * (1) _Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge._ Testimony that an item is what it is claimed to be.

  * (2) _Nonexpert Opinion About Handwriting._ A nonexpert's opinion that handwriting is genuine, based on a familiarity with it that was not acquired for the current litigation.

  * (3) _Comparison by an Expert Witness or the Trier of Fact._ A comparison with an authenticated specimen by an expert witness or the trier of fact.

  * (4) _Distinctive Characteristics and the Like._ The appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances.

  * (5) _Opinion About a Voice._ An opinion identifying a person's voice—whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording—based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances that connect it with the alleged speaker.

  * (6) _Evidence About a Telephone Conversation._ For a telephone conversation, evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time to:

    * (A) a particular person, if circumstances, including self-identification, show that the person answering was the one called; or

    * (B) a particular business, if the call was made to a business and the call related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.


  * (7) _Evidence About Public Records._ Evidence that:

    * (A) a document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law; or

    * (B) a purported public record or statement is from the office where items of this kind are kept.


  * (8) _Evidence About Ancient Documents or Data Compilations._ For a document or data compilation, evidence that it:

    * (A) is in a condition that creates no suspicion about its authenticity;

    * (B) was in a place where, if authentic, it would likely be; and

    * (C) is at least 20 years old when offered.


  * (9) _Evidence About a Process or System._ Evidence describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate result.

  * (10) _Methods Provided by a Statute or Rule._ Any method of authentication or identification allowed by a federal statute or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.

### Rule 902. Evidence That Is Self-Authenticating
* The following items of evidence are self-authenticating; they require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted:

  * (1) _Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed._ A document that bears:

    * (A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state, district, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of the United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of any of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of any entity named above; and

    * (B) a signature purporting to be an execution or attestation.


  * (2) _Domestic Public Documents That Are Not Sealed but Are Signed and Certified._ A document that bears no seal if:

    * (A) it bears the signature of an officer or employee of an entity named in Rule 902(1)(A); and

    * (B) another public officer who has a seal and official duties within that same entity certifies under seal—or its equivalent—that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.


  * (3) _Foreign Public Documents._ A document that purports to be signed or attested by a person who is authorized by a foreign country's law to do so. The document must be accompanied by a final certification that certifies the genuineness of the signature and official position of the signer or attester—or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the signature or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the signature or attestation. The certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If all parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to investigate the document's authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either:

    * (A) order that it be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification; or

    * (B) allow it to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.


  * (4) _Certified Copies of Public Records._ A copy of an official record—or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law—if the copy is certified as correct by:

    * (A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification; or

    * (B) a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a federal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.


  * (5) _Official Publications._ A book, pamphlet, or other publication purporting to be issued by a public authority.

  * (6) _Newspapers and Periodicals._ Printed material purporting to be a newspaper or periodical.

  * (7) _Trade Inscriptions and the Like._ An inscription, sign, tag, or label purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating origin, ownership, or control.

  * (8) _Acknowledged Documents._ A document accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment that is lawfully executed by a notary public or another officer who is authorized to take acknowledgments.

  * (9) _Commercial Paper and Related Documents._ Commercial paper, a signature on it, and related documents, to the extent allowed by general commercial law.

  * (10) _Presumptions Under a Federal Statute._ A signature, document, or anything else that a federal statute declares to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.

  * (11) _Certified Domestic Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity._ The original or a copy of a domestic record that meets the requirements of Rule 803(6)(A)–(C), as shown by a certification of the custodian or another qualified person that complies with a federal statute or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court. Before the trial or hearing, the proponent must give an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to offer the record—and must make the record and certification available for inspection—so that the party has a fair opportunity to challenge them.

  * (12) _Certified Foreign Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity._ In a civil case, the original or a copy of a foreign record that meets the requirements of Rule 902(11), modified as follows: the certification, rather than complying with a federal statute or Supreme Court rule, must be signed in a manner that, if falsely made, would subject the maker to a criminal penalty in the country where the certification is signed. The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).

  * (13) _Certified Records Generated by an Electronic Process or System._ A record generated by an electronic process or system that produces an accurate result, as shown by a certification of a qualified person that complies with the certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12). The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).

  * (14) _Certified Data Copied from an Electronic Device, Storage Medium, or File._ Data copied from an electronic device, storage medium, or file, if authenticated by a process of digital identification, as shown by a certification of a qualified person that complies with the certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12). The proponent also must meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).

### Rule 903. Subscribing Witness's Testimony
* A subscribing witness's testimony is necessary to authenticate a writing only if required by the law of the jurisdiction that governs its validity.
