#### (a) Authorization of payment
* An officer who is separated under section 3041(a)(2) of this title and who has completed more than three years of continuous active service immediately before that separation is entitled to separation pay computed under subsection (b) unless the Secretary determines that the conditions under which the officer is separated do not warrant payment of that pay.

#### (b) Officers first becoming members on or after September 8, 1980
