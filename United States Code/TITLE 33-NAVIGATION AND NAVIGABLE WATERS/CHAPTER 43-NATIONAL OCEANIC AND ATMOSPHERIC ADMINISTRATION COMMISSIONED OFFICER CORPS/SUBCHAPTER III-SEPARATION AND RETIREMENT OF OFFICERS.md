#### (b) Computations
* In any fiscal year, the total number of officers selected for retirement or separation under subsection (a) plus the number of officers retired for age may not exceed the whole number nearest 4 percent of the total number of officers authorized to be on the active list, except as otherwise provided by law.

#### (c) Effective date of retirements and separations
* A retirement or separation under subsection (a) shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month beginning after the date on which the Secretary approves the retirement or separation, except that if the officer concerned requests an earlier retirement or separation date, the date shall be as determined by the Secretary.

#### (d) Deferment of retirement or separation for medical reasons
* #### (1) In general
  * If the Secretary determines that the evaluation of the medical condition of an officer requires hospitalization or medical observation that cannot be completed with confidence in a manner consistent with the officer's well-being before the date on which the officer would otherwise be required to retire or be separated under this section, the Secretary may defer the retirement or separation of the officer.

* #### (2) Consent required

#### (a) Authorization of payment
* An officer who is separated under section 3041(a)(2) of this title and who has completed more than three years of continuous active service immediately before that separation is entitled to separation pay computed under subsection (b) unless the Secretary determines that the conditions under which the officer is separated do not warrant payment of that pay.

#### (b) Amount of separation pay
* #### (1) Six or more years
  * In the case of an officer who has completed six or more years of continuous active service immediately before that separation, the amount of separation pay to be paid to the officer under this section is 10 percent of the product of—

#### (b) Officers first becoming members on or after September 8, 1980
* Each officer on the retired list who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980, shall receive retired pay at the rate determined by multiplying—
