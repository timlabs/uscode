#### (b) Operation and maintenance
* #### (1) In general
  * The Federal share of the cost of operation and maintenance of each navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor constructed by the Secretary pursuant to this Act or any other law approved after November 17, 1986, shall be 100 percent, except that in the case of a deep-draft harbor, the non-Federal interests shall be responsible for an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the cost of the operation and maintenance of such project over the cost which the Secretary determines would be incurred for operation and maintenance of such project if such project had a depth of 50 feet.

* #### (2) Dredged material disposal facilities
  * The Federal share of the cost of constructing land-based and aquatic dredged material disposal facilities that are necessary for the disposal of dredged material required for the operation and maintenance of a project and for which a contract for construction has not been awarded on or before October 12, 1996, shall be determined in accordance with subsection (a).

#### (c) Erosion or shoaling attributable to Federal navigation works
* Costs of constructing projects or measures for the prevention or mitigation of erosion or shoaling damages attributable to Federal navigation works shall be shared in the same proportion as the cost sharing provisions applicable to the project causing such erosion or shoaling. The non-Federal interests for the project causing the erosion or shoaling shall agree to operate and maintain such measures.

#### (d) Non-Federal payments during construction
* The amount of any non-Federal share of the cost of any navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor shall be paid to the Secretary. Amounts required to be paid during construction shall be paid on an annual basis during the period of construction, beginning not later than one year after construction is initiated.

#### (e) Agreement
* Before initiation of construction of a project to which this section applies, the Secretary and the non-Federal interests shall enter into a cooperative agreement according to the provisions of section 1962d–5b of title 42. The non-Federal interests shall agree to—

  * (1) provide to the Federal Government lands, easements, and rights-of-way, including those necessary for dredged material disposal facilities, and perform the necessary relocations required for construction, operation, and maintenance of such project;

  * (2) hold and save the United States free from damages due to the construction or operation and maintenance of the project, except for damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractors;

  * (2) funds expended for such construction are apportioned equitably in accordance with regional needs; and

  * (3) use of a dredged material disposal facility designed, constructed, managed, or operated by a private entity is not precluded if, consistent with economic and environmental considerations, the facility is the least-cost alternative.

The term includes any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan. For a project for which the Federal cost does not exceed $1,000,000, the term includes a planning and design analysis document.

* #### (2) Feasibility study
  * The term "feasibility study" means a study that results in a feasibility report under section 2282 of this title, and any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan, prepared by the Corps of Engineers for a water resources project.

### §2216. Rate of interest
* Whenever a non-Federal interest is required or elects to repay an amount under this Act over a period of time, the amount to be repaid shall include interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which costs for the construction of the project are first incurred (or in the case of recalculation the fiscal year in which the recalculation is made), plus a premium of one-eighth of one percentage point for transaction costs; except that such rates for hydroelectric power shall be in accordance with existing law.

### §2217. Limitation on applicability of certain provisions in reports
* If any provision in any report designated by this Act recommends that a State contribute in cash 5 percent of the construction costs allocated to non-vendible project purposes and 10 percent of the construction costs allocated to vendible project purposes, such provision shall not apply to the project recommended in such report.

### §2218. General applicability of cost sharing
* Unless otherwise specified, the cost sharing provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all projects in this Act. The Federal share of any cost of a project authorized by this Act for which cost a Federal share is not established in this subchapter, shall be the share of such cost otherwise provided by law.

### §2219. Definitions
* For purposes of this subchapter, terms shall have the meanings given by section 2241 of this title.
