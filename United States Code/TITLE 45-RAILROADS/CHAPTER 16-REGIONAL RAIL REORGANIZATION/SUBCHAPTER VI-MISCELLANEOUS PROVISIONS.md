* (2) All securities of the Corporation which are issued to the Association as the initial holder, or which are issued in connection with the transfer to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof of rail properties under this chapter, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been issued subject to and authorized pursuant to section 11301 of title 49.

* (3) The provisions of section 77e of title 15, shall not apply to transactions involving the issuance of any security of the Corporation to the Association, transactions involving the issuance of any security of the Corporation that is deposited with the special court pursuant to section 743(a) of this title, or transactions involving the issuance or distribution of any security of the Corporation, where the terms and conditions of such issuance or distribution are approved by the special court pursuant to section 743(c) of this title.

* (4) The powers and duties of the Commission under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, with respect to a railroad in reorganization in the region which conveys all or substantially all of its designated rail properties to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof, or to profitable railroads in the region, pursuant to the final system plan, and the requirement that plans of reorganization be filed with the Commission, shall cease upon the date of such conveyance. The powers and duties of the Commission under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act shall also so terminate, as of February 5, 1976, with respect to any railroad in reorganization under such section 77 but not subject to this chapter which (1) does not operate any line of railroad, and (2) has transferred all or substantially all of its rail properties to a railroad in reorganization in the region which was subject to this chapter prior to February 5, 1976.

Such court shall proceed to reorganize or liquidate such railroad in reorganization pursuant to such section 77 on such terms as the court deems just and reasonable, or pursuant to any other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, if the court finds that such action would be in the best interests of such estate.
