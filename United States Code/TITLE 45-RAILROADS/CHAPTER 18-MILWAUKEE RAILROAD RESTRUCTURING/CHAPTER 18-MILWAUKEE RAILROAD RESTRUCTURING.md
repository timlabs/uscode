### **CHAPTER 18—MILWAUKEE RAILROAD RESTRUCTURING**

### §901. Congressional findings
* (a) Congress hereby finds that—

  * (1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation of its operations in the near future;

  * (2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates (the States of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);

  * (3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;

  * (4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of the Milwaukee Railroad;

  * (5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in reorganization and should be given serious consideration;

  * (6) cessation of essential transportation services by the Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;

  * (7) cessation of such services is imminent; and

  * (8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.


* (b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential services by the Milwaukee Railroad would otherwise cause.
