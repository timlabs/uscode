### **CHAPTER 19—ROCK ISLAND RAILROAD EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE**

### §1001. Congressional findings
* Congress hereby finds that—

  * (1) uninterrupted continuation of services over Rock Island lines is dependent on adequate employee protection provisions covering Rock Island Railroad employees who are not hired by other railroads;

  * (2) for those Rock Island Railroad employees not hired by other rail carriers, there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet the necessary costs of such employee protection that are assumed by the Rock Island Railroad;

  * (3) a cessation of necessary operations of the Rock Island Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates; and

  * (4) premature cessation of services over lines which are the subject of pending purchase application would result in harm to the shipping public and could imperil continuation of vital commuter service.

### §1002. Definitions
* As used in this chapter, the term—

  * (1) "bankruptcy court" means the court having jurisdiction over the reorganization of the Rock Island Railroad;

  * (2) "Board" means the Railroad Retirement Board;

  * (3) "Commission" means the Interstate Commerce Commission;

  * (4) "employee" includes any employee of the Rock Island Railroad as of August 1, 1979, but does not include any individual serving as president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, comptroller, counsel, member of the board of directors, or any other person performing such functions;

  * (5) the term "Rock Island Railroad" means the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company, the estate of such Company in its reorganization proceeding, or the trustee appointed in such proceeding; and

  * (6) the term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Transportation.

### §1003. Service continuation
#### (a) Situations requiring directed service; time period
* Notwithstanding the provisions of Public Law 96–131, the Commission shall order directed service for a period of not to exceed 90 days over any line of the Rock Island Railroad if the Secretary finds and certifies to the Commission that—

  * (1) a lack of rail service exists which cannot be resolved by a grant of interim operating authority over such line and grains or foods are ready to be shipped to market; or

  * (2) a lack of rail service exists which cannot be resolved by a grant of interim operating authority over such line and a rail carrier, shipper, State, or other interested party has expressed in writing to the Secretary an interest in purchasing, leasing, or rehabilitating the particular rail line or facility for purposes of providing rail services, and there is a reasonable expectation that such transaction will be consummated.

#### (b) Availability of funds
* (1) Not more than $15,000,000 of the funds available for expenditure by the Secretary out of the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Fund established under title V of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 U.S.C. 821 et seq.) may be made available by the Secretary to the Commission for purposes of providing directed service under this section and section 916(b) of this title.

* (2) Funds may be made available for directed service under this section without regard to the findings of the Secretary required under title V of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 [45 U.S.C. 821 et seq.], and section 516 of such Act (45 U.S.C. 836) shall not apply to any directed service provided with such funds.

#### (c) Continuation of compensation terms for trackage rights, joint facilities, etc.
* The terms of compensation for all trackage rights, joint facilities, and similar arrangements between other rail carriers and the trustee of the Rock Island Railroad which are in effect on or after March 15, 1980, on portions of the lines of the Rock Island Railroad involved in temporary emergency operations shall be continued in effect during the duration of the temporary emergency operating authority with the carrier providing temporary emergency service substituting for the trustee, except where the Rock Island Railroad has been given more favorable treatment by virtue of its bankruptcy. Such continuation shall not alter or affect the ultimate rights of other rail carriers under trackage rights, joint facilities, or similar arrangements nor prejudice the ultimate determination of any controversy or proceeding concerning rights of the parties with regard to assignment by the trustee of rights in or to the facilities or under the arrangements.

### §1004. Railroad hiring
* (a) Each person who is an employee of the Rock Island Railroad on August 1, 1979, and who, prior to January 1, 1984, is separated or furloughed (other than for cause) from his employment with such railroad, or from his employment with another rail carrier providing temporary service over lines of the Rock Island Railroad, as a result of a reduction of service by such railroad or such temporary service carrier shall, unless found to be less qualified than other applicants, have the first right of hire by any other rail carrier that is subject to regulation by the Commission for any vacancy that is not covered by (1) an affirmative action plan, or a hiring plan designed to eliminate discrimination, that is required by Federal or State statute, regulations, or Executive order, or by the order of a Federal or State court or agency, or (2) a permissible voluntary affirmative action plan. For purposes of this section, a rail carrier shall not be considered to be hiring new employees when it recalls any of its own furloughed employees.

In no case before abandonment has been approved and before the 180-day period has elapsed shall the Secretary approve a disposition of such portion of the rail line or related facility to any carrier or other entity not engaged in providing railroad services or not formed for the purpose of providing railroad services.
