That portion may be used only to pay claims for personal injury or death.

* (c) CALCULATION OF TONNAGE.—Under subsection (b), the tonnage of a self-propelled vessel is the gross tonnage without deduction for engine room, and the tonnage of a sailing vessel is the tonnage for documentation. However, space for the use of seamen is excluded.

  * (2) the court finds there was a satisfactory reason why the notice could not have been given; or
