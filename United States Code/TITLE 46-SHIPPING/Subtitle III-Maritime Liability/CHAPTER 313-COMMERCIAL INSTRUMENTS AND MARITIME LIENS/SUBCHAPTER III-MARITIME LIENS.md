  * (4) state the name and address of the person; and

  * (5) be signed and acknowledged.


* (b)(1) The Secretary shall record a notice complying with subsection (a) of this section if, when the notice is presented to the Secretary for recording, the person having the claim files with the notice a declaration stating the following:

  * (A) The information in the notice is true and correct to the best of the knowledge, information, and belief of the individual who signed it.

  * (B) A copy of the notice, as presented for recordation, has been sent to each of the following:

Venue in such an action shall be in the district where the vessel is found or where the claimant resides or where the notice of claim of lien is recorded.
