### **CHAPTER 556—MARINE HIGHWAYS**

### §55601. Marine highways transportation program
* (a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a marine highway transportation program to be known as the "America's Marine highway program" and designate marine highway transportation projects to be conducted under the program to provide a coordinated and capable alternative to landside transportation or to promote marine highway transportation.

* (b) PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—The program shall encourage the use of marine highway transportation through the development and expansion of—

  * (1) vessels documented under chapter 121 of this title;

  * (2) shipper utilization;

  * (3) port and landside infrastructure; and

  * (4) marine transportation strategies by State and local governments.


* (c) MARINE HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION ROUTES.—The Secretary shall designate marine highway transportation routes as extensions of the surface transportation system to focus public and private efforts to use the waterways to relieve landside congestion along coastal corridors or to promote marine highway transportation. The Secretary may collect and disseminate data for the designation and delineation of marine highway transportation routes.

* (d) PROJECT DESIGNATION.—The Secretary may designate a project to be a marine highway transportation project if the Secretary determines that the project uses documented vessels and—

  * (1) mitigates landside congestion; or

  * (2) promotes marine highway transportation.


* (e) ELEMENTS OF PROGRAM.—For a marine highway transportation project designated under this section, the Secretary may—

  * (1) promote the development of marine highway transportation services;

  * (2) coordinate, with ports, State departments of transportation, localities, other public agencies, and the private sector and on the development of landside facilities and infrastructure to support marine highway transportation services; and

  * (3) develop performance measures for the marine highway transportation program.


* (f) MULTISTATE, STATE AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING.—The Secretary, in consultation with Federal entities and State and local governments, may develop strategies to encourage the use of marine highway transportation for transportation of passengers and cargo. The Secretary may—

  * (1) assess the extent to which States and local governments include marine highway transportation and other marine transportation solutions in their transportation planning;

  * (2) encourage State departments of transportation to develop strategies, where appropriate, to incorporate marine highway transportation, ferries, and other marine transportation solutions for regional and interstate transport of freight and passengers in their transportation planning; and

  * (3) encourage groups of States and multi-State transportation entities to determine how marine highway transportation can address congestion, bottlenecks, and other interstate transportation challenges.


* (g) GRANTS.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall establish and implement a marine highway transportation grant program to implement projects or components of a project designated under subsection (d).

  * (2) APPLICATIONS.—In order to receive a grant under the program, an applicant shall—

    * (A) submit an application to the Secretary, in such form and manner, at such time, and containing such information as the Secretary may require; and

    * (B) demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

      * (i) the project is financially viable;

      * (ii) the funds received will be spent efficiently and effectively; and

      * (iii) a market exists for the services of the proposed project as evidenced by contracts or written statements of intent from potential customers.


  * (3) NON-FEDERAL SHARE.—An applicant shall provide at least 20 percent of the project costs from non-Federal sources. In awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall give a preference to those projects or components that present the most financially viable transportation services and require the lowest percentage Federal share of the costs.

### §55602. Cargo and shippers
* (a) MEMORANDUMS OF AGREEMENT.—The Secretary of Transportation shall enter into memorandums of understanding with the heads of other Federal entities to transport federally owned or generated cargo using a marine highway transportation project designated under section 55601 when practical or available.

* (b) SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES.—The Secretary shall consult shippers and other participants in transportation logistics and develop proposals for short-term incentives to encourage the use of marine highway transportation.

### §55604. Research on marine highway transportation
* The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, may conduct research on marine highway transportation, regarding—

  * (1) the environmental and transportation benefits to be derived from marine highway transportation alternatives for other forms of transportation;

  * (2) technology, vessel design, and other improvements that would reduce emissions, increase fuel economy, and lower costs of marine highway transportation and increase the efficiency of intermodal transfers; and

  * (3) solutions to impediments to marine highway transportation projects designated under section 55601.

### §55605. Marine highway transportation defined
* In this chapter, the term "marine highway transportation" means the carriage by a documented vessel of cargo—

  * (1) that is—

    * (A) contained in intermodal cargo containers and loaded by crane on the vessel;

    * (B) loaded on the vessel by means of wheeled technology;

    * (C) shipped in discrete units or packages that are handled individually, palletized, or unitized for purposes of transportation; or

    * (D) freight vehicles carried aboard commuter ferry boats; and


  * (2) that is—

    * (A) loaded at a port in the United States and unloaded either at another port in the United States or at a port in Canada located in the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway System; or

    * (B) loaded at a port in Canada located in the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway System and unloaded at a port in the United States.
