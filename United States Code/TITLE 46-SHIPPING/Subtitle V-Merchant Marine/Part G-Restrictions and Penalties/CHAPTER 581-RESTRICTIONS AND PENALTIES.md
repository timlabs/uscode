### §58107. Discrimination at ports by water common carriers
* (a) PROHIBITION.—A common carrier by water may not, directly or indirectly, through an agreement, conference, association, understanding, or otherwise, prevent or attempt to prevent any other common carrier by water from serving any port described in subsection (b) at the same rates the first carrier charges at the nearest port already regularly served by it.

On receiving the certification, the Board may by order suspend the operation of subsection (a) with respect to the rates, fares, and charges for the transportation by rail of persons and property transported from or to be transported to those ports, for such time and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify in the order or in any supplemental order.
