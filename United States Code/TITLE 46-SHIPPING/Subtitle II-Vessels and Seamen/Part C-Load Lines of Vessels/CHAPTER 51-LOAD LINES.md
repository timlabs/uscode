    * (B) a place outside that territory, possession, or Trust Territory.


  * (2) "economic benefit of the overloading" means the amount obtained by multiplying the weight of the overload (in tons) by the lesser of—

    * (A) the average freight rate value of a ton of the vessel's cargo for the voyage; or

    * (B) $50.


  * (3) "existing vessel" means—

    * (A) a vessel on a domestic voyage, the keel of which was laid, or that was at a similar stage of construction, before January 1, 1986; and

  * (1) the service, type, and character of the vessel;

  * (2) the geographic area in which the vessel will operate; and

  * (3) applicable international agreements to which the United States Government is a party.


* (c) An existing vessel may retain its load lines assigned before January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that a substantial change in the vessel after those load lines were assigned requires that new load lines be assigned under this chapter.

* (d) The minimum freeboard of an existing vessel may be reduced only if the vessel complies with every applicable provision of this chapter.

* (e) The Secretary may designate by regulation specific geographic areas that have less severe weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to return to available safe harbors. The Secretary may reduce the minimum freeboard of a vessel operating in these areas.

### §5105. Load line surveys

* (b) The certificate shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.

### §5107. Delegation of authority
* (a) The Secretary shall delegate to the American Bureau of Shipping or other similarly qualified organizations the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine that load lines are marked correctly, and issue load line certificates under this chapter.

* (b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a decision of an organization delegated authority under subsection (a) of this section related to the assignment of a load line may be appealed to the Secretary.

* (c) For a vessel intended to be engaged on a foreign voyage, the Secretary may delegate to another country that is a party to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine that the load lines are marked correctly, and issue an International Load Line Certificate (1966).

* (a) When the Secretary finds that the laws and regulations of a foreign country related to load lines are similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, or when a foreign country is a party to an international load line agreement to which the United States Government is a party, the Secretary shall accept the load line marks and certificate of a vessel of that foreign country as complying with this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter. The Secretary may control the vessel as provided for in the applicable international agreement.
