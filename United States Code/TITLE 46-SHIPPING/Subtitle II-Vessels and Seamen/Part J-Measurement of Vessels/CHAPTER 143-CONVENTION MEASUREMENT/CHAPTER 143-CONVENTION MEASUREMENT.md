### **CHAPTER 143—CONVENTION MEASUREMENT**

### §14301. Application
* (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, this chapter applies to any vessel for which the application of an international agreement or other law of the United States to the vessel depends on the vessel's tonnage.

* (b) This chapter does not apply to the following:

  * (1) a vessel of war, unless the government of the country to which the vessel belongs elects to measure the vessel under this chapter.

  * (2) a vessel of less than 24 meters (79 feet) overall in length.

  * (3) a vessel of United States or Canadian registry or nationality, or a vessel operated under the authority of the United States or Canada, and that is operating only on the Great Lakes, unless the owner requests.

  * (4) a vessel of United States registry or nationality, or one operated under the authority of the United States (except a vessel that engages on a foreign voyage) the keel of which was laid or that was at a similar stage of construction before January 1, 1986, unless—

    * (A) the owner requests; or

    * (B) the vessel undergoes a change that the Secretary finds substantially affects the vessel's gross tonnage.


  * (5) a barge of United States registry or nationality, or a barge operated under the authority of the United States (except a barge that engages on a foreign voyage) unless the owner requests.


* (c) An existing vessel that has not undergone a change that the Secretary finds substantially affects the vessel's gross tonnage (or a vessel to which IMO Resolutions A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981, A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, or A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, apply) may retain its tonnages existing on July 18, 1994, for the application of relevant requirements under international agreements (except the Convention) and other laws of the United States. However, if the vessel undergoes a change substantially affecting its tonnage after July 18, 1994, the vessel shall be remeasured under this chapter.

* (d) This chapter does not affect an international agreement to which the United States Government is a party that is not in conflict with the Convention or the application of IMO Resolutions A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981, A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, and A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983.

### §14302. Measurement
* (a) The Secretary shall measure a vessel to which this chapter applies in the way provided by this chapter and the Convention.

* (b) A vessel measured under this chapter may not be required to be measured under another law.

* (c) Unless otherwise provided by law, the measurement of a vessel under this chapter applies to a law of the United States whose applicability depends on a vessel's tonnage, if that law—

  * (1) becomes effective after July 18, 1994; or

  * (2) is in effect before July 19, 1994, is not enumerated in section 14305 of this title, and is identified by the Secretary by regulation as a law to which this chapter applies.

### §14303. Tonnage Certificate
* (a) After measuring a vessel under this chapter, the Secretary shall issue, on request of the owner, an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) and deliver it to the owner or master of the vessel. For a vessel to which the Convention does not apply, the Secretary shall prescribe a certificate to be issued as evidence of a vessel's measurement under this chapter.

* (b) The certificate issued under this section shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.

### §14304. Remeasurement
* (a) To the extent necessary, the Secretary shall remeasure a vessel to which this chapter applies if—

  * (1) the Secretary or the owner alleges an error in its measurement; or

  * (2) the vessel or the use of its space is changed in a way that substantially affects its tonnage.


* (b) Except as provided in this chapter or section 14504 of this title, a vessel that has been measured does not have to be remeasured to obtain another document or endorsement under chapter 121 of this title.

### §14305. Optional regulatory measurement
* (a) On request of the owner of a vessel measured under this chapter that is of United States registry or nationality, or a vessel operated under the authority of the United States, the Secretary also shall measure the vessel under chapter 145 of this title. The tonnages determined under that chapter shall be used in applying—

* (b) As long as the owner of a vessel has a request in effect under subsection (a) of this section, the tonnages determined under that request shall be used in applying the other provisions of law described in subsection (a) to that vessel.

### §14306. Reciprocity for foreign vessels
* (a) When the Secretary finds that the laws and regulations of a foreign country related to measurement of vessels are similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, or when a foreign country is a party to the Convention, the Secretary shall accept the measurement and certificate of a vessel of that foreign country as complying with this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter.

* (b) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a vessel of a foreign country that does not recognize measurements under this chapter. The Secretary may apply measurement standards the Secretary considers appropriate to the vessel, subject to applicable international agreements to which the United States Government is a party.

### §14307. Inspection of foreign vessels
* (a) The Secretary may inspect a vessel of a foreign country to verify that—

  * (1) the vessel has an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) and the main characteristics of the vessel correspond to the information in the certificate; or

  * (2) if the vessel is from a country not a party to the Convention, the vessel has been measured under laws and regulations similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter.


* (b) For a vessel of a country that is a party to the Convention, if the inspection reveals that the vessel does not have an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) or that the main characteristics of the vessel differ from those stated on the certificate or other records in a way that increases the gross or net tonnage of the vessel, the Secretary promptly shall inform the country whose flag the vessel is flying.

* (c) For a vessel of a country not a party to the Convention—

  * (1) if the vessel has been measured under laws and regulations that the Secretary finds are similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, the vessel shall be deemed to have been issued an International Tonnage Certificate (1969); and

  * (2) if the vessel has not been measured as described in clause (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may measure the vessel.


* (d) An inspection under this section shall be conducted in a way that does not delay a vessel of a country that is a party to the Convention.
