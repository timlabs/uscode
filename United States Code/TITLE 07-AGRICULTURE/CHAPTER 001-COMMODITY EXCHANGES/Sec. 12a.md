  * (7) to alter or supplement the rules of a registered entity insofar as necessary or appropriate by rule or regulation or by order, if after making the appropriate request in writing to a registered entity that such registered entity effect on its own behalf specified changes in its rules and practices, and after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission determines that such registered entity has not made the changes so required, and that such changes are necessary or appropriate for the protection of persons producing, handling, processing, or consuming any commodity traded for future delivery on such registered entity, or the product or byproduct thereof, or for the protection of traders or to insure fair dealing in commodities traded for future delivery on such registered entity. Such rules, regulations, or orders may specify changes with respect to such matters as—

    * (A) terms or conditions in contracts of sale to be executed on or subject to the rules of such registered entity;

    * (B) the form or manner of execution of purchases and sales for future delivery;

    * (C) other trading requirements;

    * (D) margin requirements, provided that the rules, regulations, or orders shall—

      * (i) be limited to protecting the financial integrity of the derivatives clearing organization;

      * (ii) be designed for risk management purposes to protect the financial integrity of transactions; and

      * (iii) not set specific margin amounts;


    * (E) safeguards with respect to the financial responsibility of members;

    * (F) the manner, method, and place of soliciting business, including the content of such solicitations; and

    * (G) the form and manner of handling, recording, and accounting for customers' orders, transactions, and accounts;


  * (8) to make and promulgate such rules and regulations with respect to those persons registered under this chapter, who are not members of a registered entity, as in the judgment of the Commission are reasonably necessary to protect the public interest and promote just and equitable principles of trade, including but not limited to the manner, method, and place of soliciting business, including the content of such solicitation;

  * (9) to direct the registered entity, whenever it has reason to believe that an emergency exists, to take such action as in the Commission's judgment is necessary to maintain or restore orderly trading in or liquidation of any futures contract, including, but not limited to, the setting of temporary emergency margin levels on any futures contract, and the fixing of limits that may apply to a market position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of the Commission's action. The term "emergency" as used herein shall mean, in addition to threatened or actual market manipulations and corners, any act of the United States or a foreign government affecting a commodity or any other major market disturbance which prevents the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for such commodity. Any action taken by the Commission under this paragraph shall be subject to review only in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party seeking review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Such review shall be based upon an examination of all the information before the Commission at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the Commission's action shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless it has determined, after notice and hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the meaning or interpretation given by a registered entity to the terms "market emergency", "emergency", or equivalent language in its own bylaws, rules, regulations, or resolutions;

  * (10) to authorize any person to perform any portion of the registration functions under this chapter, in accordance with rules, notwithstanding any other provision of law, adopted by such person and submitted to the Commission for approval or, if applicable, for review pursuant to section 21(j) of this title, and subject to the provisions of this chapter applicable to registrations granted by the Commission; and

  * (11)(A) by written notice served on the person and pursuant to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Commission may adopt, to suspend or modify the registration of any person registered under this chapter who is charged (in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney or an appropriate official of any State) with the commission of or participation in a crime involving a violation of this chapter, or a violation of any other provision of Federal or State law that would reflect on the honesty or the fitness of the person to act as a fiduciary (including an offense specified in subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph (2)) that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, if the Commission determines that continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.

  * (B) Prior to the suspension or modification of the registration of a person under this paragraph, the person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing at which the Commission shall have the burden of showing that the continued registration of the person does, or is likely to, pose a threat to the public interest or threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.

  * (C) Any notice of suspension or modification issued under this paragraph shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is disposed of or until terminated by the Commission.

  * (D) On disposition of such information, indictment, or complaint, the Commission may issue and serve on such person an order pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) to suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration of such person.

  * (E) A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Commission from thereafter instituting any other proceedings under this chapter.

  * (F) A person aggrieved by an order issued under this paragraph may obtain review of such order in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 8(b) of this title.
