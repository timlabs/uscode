* (B) The Commission, in requiring reports pursuant to this paragraph, shall specify the information required, the period for which it is required, the time and date on which the information must be furnished, and whether the information is to be furnished directly to the Commission or to a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility or other self-regulatory organization with primary responsibility for examining the registered futures commission merchant's financial and operational condition.

* (4)(A) in developing and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) with respect to affiliated persons subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall consult with and consider the views of each such Federal banking agency. If a Federal banking agency comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Commission under this subsection that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to the written comment before adopting the proposed rule. The Commission shall, at the request of the Federal banking agency, publish the comment and response in the Federal Register at the time of publishing the adopted rule.

* (B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), a registered futures commission merchant shall be considered to have complied with a recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to paragraph (2) concerning an affiliated person that is subject to examination by, or reporting requirements of, a Federal banking agency if the futures commission merchant utilizes for the recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports filed by the affiliated person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to section 161 of title 12, section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), section 1817(a) of title 12, section 1467a(b) of title 12, or section 1844 of title 12.

* (ii) The Commission may, by rule adopted pursuant to paragraph (2), require any futures commission merchant filing the reports with the Commission to obtain, maintain, or report supplemental information if the Commission makes an explicit finding that the supplemental information is necessary to inform the Commission regarding potential risks to the futures commission merchant. Prior to requiring any such supplemental information, the Commission shall first request the Federal banking agency to expand its reporting requirements to include the information.

* (5) Prior to making a request pursuant to paragraph (3) for information with respect to an affiliated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall—

  * (A) notify the agency of the information required with respect to the affiliated person; and

  * (B) consult with the agency to determine whether the information required is available from the agency and for other purposes, unless the Commission determines that any delay resulting from the consultation would be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition of the futures commission merchant or the stability or integrity of the futures markets.


* (6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Commission to require any futures commission merchant to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analysis contained in the report.

* (7) No information provided to or obtained by the Commission from any Federal banking agency pursuant to a request under paragraph (5) regarding any affiliated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency may be disclosed to any other person (other than as provided in section 12 of this title or section 12a(6) of this title), without the prior written approval of the Federal banking agency.

* (9) The Commission, by rule, regulation, or order, may exempt any person or class of persons under such terms and conditions and for such periods as the Commission shall provide in the rule, regulation, or order, from this subsection and the rules and regulations issued under this subsection. In granting the exemption, the Commission shall consider, among other factors—

  * (A) whether information of the type required under this subsection is available from a supervisory agency (as defined in section 3401(7) of title 12), a State insurance commission or similar State agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a similar foreign regulator;

  * (B) the primary business of any affiliated person;

* (10) Information required to be provided pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to section 12 of this title. Except as specifically provided in section 12 of this title and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information required to be reported under this subsection, or any information supplied to the Commission by any domestic or foreign regulatory agency that relates to the financial or operational condition of any affiliated person of a registered futures commission merchant.

* (11) Nothing in paragraphs (1) through (10) shall be construed to supersede or to limit in any way the authority or powers of the Commission pursuant to any other provision of this chapter or regulations issued under this chapter.
