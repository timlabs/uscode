### §6q. Special procedures to encourage and facilitate bona fide hedging by agricultural producers
#### (a) Authority
* The Commission shall consider issuing rules or orders which—

  * (1) prescribe procedures under which each contract market is to provide for orderly delivery, including temporary storage costs, of any agricultural commodity enumerated in section 1a(9) of this title which is the subject of a contract for purchase or sale for future delivery;

  * (2) increase the ease with which domestic agricultural producers may participate in contract markets, including by addressing cost and margin requirements, so as to better enable the producers to hedge price risk associated with their production;

  * (3) provide flexibility in the minimum quantities of such agricultural commodities that may be the subject of a contract for purchase or sale for future delivery that is traded on a contract market, to better allow domestic agricultural producers to hedge such price risk; and

  * (4) encourage contract markets to provide information and otherwise facilitate the participation of domestic agricultural producers in contract markets.

#### (b) Report
* Within 1 year after December 21, 2000, the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report on the steps it has taken to implement this section and on the activities of contract markets pursuant to this section.
