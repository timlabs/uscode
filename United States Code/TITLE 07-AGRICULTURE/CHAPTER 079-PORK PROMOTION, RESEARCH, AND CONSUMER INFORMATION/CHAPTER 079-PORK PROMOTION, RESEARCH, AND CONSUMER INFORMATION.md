* (a) Congress finds that—

  * (1) pork and pork products are basic foods that are a valuable and healthy part of the human diet;

  * (2) the production of pork and pork products plays a significant role in the economy of the United States because pork and pork products are—

  * (5) pork and pork products move in interstate and foreign commerce;

  * (6) pork and pork products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in pork and pork products; and

  * (A) strengthen the position of the pork industry in the marketplace; and
