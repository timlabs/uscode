  | Commodity | Maximum quantity | Minimum quantity |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Wheat (bushels) | 500,000,000 | 400,000,000 |
  | Upland cotton (bales) | 4,000,000 | 3,000,000 |

  | Nonfat dry milk solids (pounds) | 300,000,000 | 0 |
  | Cheese (pounds) | 150,000,000 | 0 |
  

* Such quantities shall be known as the "commodity set-aside".

### §1742. Determination of commodity value for set-aside
* Quantities of commodities shall not be included in the commodity set-aside which have an aggregate value in excess of $2,500,000,000. The value of the commodities placed in the commodity set-aside, for the purpose of this section, shall be the Corporation's investment in such commodities as of the date they are included in the commodity set-aside, as determined by the Secretary.

### §1743. Reduction of set-aside
* (a) Such commodity set-aside shall be reduced by disposals made in accordance with the directions of the President as follows:

  * (1) Donation, sale, or other disposition for disaster or other relief purposes outside the United States pursuant to and subject to the limitations of subchapter III of chapter 41 of this title;

  * (2) Sale or barter (including barter for strategic materials) to develop new or expanded markets for American agricultural commodities, including but not limited to disposition pursuant to and subject to the limitations of subchapter II of chapter 41 of this title;

  * (3) Donation to school-lunch programs;

  * (4) Transfer to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), without reimbursement from funds appropriated for the purposes of that Act;

  * (5) Donation, sale, or other disposition for research, experimental, or educational purposes;

  * (6) Donation, sale, or other disposition for disaster relief purposes in the United States or to meet any national emergency declared by the President; and

  * (7) Sale for unrestricted use to meet a need for increased supplies at not less than 105 per centum of the parity price in the case of agricultural commodities and a price reflecting 105 per centum of the parity price of the agricultural commodity in the case of products of agricultural commodities.


* The President shall prescribe such terms and conditions for the disposal of commodities in the commodity set-aside as he determines will provide adequate safeguards against interference with normal marketings of the supplies of such commodities outside the commodity set-aside. Strategic materials acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.], and the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be reimbursed for the value of the commodities bartered for such strategic materials from funds appropriated for purposes of that Act. For the purpose of such reimbursement, the value of any commodity so bartered shall be the lower of the domestic market price or the Commodity Credit Corporation's investment therein as of the date of such barter, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture.

* (b) The quantity of any commodity in the commodity set-aside shall be reduced to the extent that the Commodity Credit Corporation inventory of such commodity is reduced, by natural or other cause beyond the control of the Corporation, below the quantity then charged to the commodity set-aside.

### §1744. Sale of commodities in set-aside; exemption from pricing limitations
* (a) The Corporation shall have authority to sell, without regard to section 1743(a)(7) of this title, any commodity covered by the commodity set-aside for the purpose of rotating stocks or consolidating inventories, any such sale to be offset by purchase of the same commodity in a substantially equivalent quantity or of a substantially equivalent value.

* (b) Dispositions pursuant to this chapter shall not be subject to the pricing limitations of section 1427 of this title.

### §1745. Computation of carryover
* The quantity of any commodity in the commodity set-aside or transferred from the set-aside to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.) shall be excluded from the computation of "carryover" for the purpose of determining the price support level for such commodity under the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], and related legislation, but shall be included in the computation of total supplies for purposes of acreage allotments and marketing quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and related legislation. Until such time as the commodity set-aside has been completed, such quantity of the commodity as the Secretary shall determine between the maximum and minimum quantities specified in section 1741 of this title shall be excluded from the computations of "carryover" for the purpose of determining the price support level, but shall be included in the computation of total supplies for purposes of acreage allotments and marketing quotas, for the 1955 crop of the commodity, notwithstanding that the quantity so excluded may not have been acquired by the Corporation and included in the commodity set-aside.

### §1746. Records and accounts
* The Commodity Credit Corporation shall keep such records and accounts as may be necessary to show, for each commodity set-aside, the initial and current composition, value (in accordance with section 1742 of this title), current investment, quantity disposed of, method of disposition, and amounts received on disposition.

### §1747. Authorization of appropriations; determination of value of transferred commodity
* In order to make payment to the Commodity Credit Corporation for any commodities transferred to the national stockpile pursuant to section 1743(a)(4) of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated amounts equal to the value of any commodities so transferred. The value of any commodity so transferred, for the purpose of this section, shall be the lower of the domestic market price or the Commodity Credit Corporation's investment therein as of the date of transfer to the stockpile, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture
