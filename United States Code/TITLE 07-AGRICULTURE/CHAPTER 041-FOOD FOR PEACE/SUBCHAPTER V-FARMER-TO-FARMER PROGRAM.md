#### (c) Special emphasis on sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries
* #### (1) Findings
  * Congress finds that—

      * (i) standard growing practices;

      * (ii) insecticide and sanitation procedures; and

      * (iii) other agricultural methods that will produce increased yields of more nutritious and healthful crops;


    * (B) agricultural producers in the United States (including African-American agricultural producers) and banking and insurance professionals have agribusiness expertise that would be invaluable for agricultural producers in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries;

    * (C) a commitment by the United States is appropriate to support the development of a comprehensive agricultural skills training program for those agricultural producers that focuses on—

      * (i) improving knowledge of insecticide and sanitation procedures to prevent crop destruction;

      * (ii) teaching modern agricultural techniques that would facilitate a continual analysis of crop production, including—

        * (I) the identification and development of standard growing practices; and

        * (II) the establishment of systems for recordkeeping;


      * (iii) the use and maintenance of agricultural equipment that is appropriate for the majority of eligible agricultural producers in sub-Saharan African or Caribbean Basin countries;
