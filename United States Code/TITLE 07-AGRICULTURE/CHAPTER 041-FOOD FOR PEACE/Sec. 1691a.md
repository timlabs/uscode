### §1691a. Food aid to developing countries
#### (a) Policy
* In light of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and the Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Program on Least-Developed and Net-Food Importing Developing Countries, the United States reaffirms the commitment of the United States to providing food aid to developing countries.

#### (b) Sense of Congress
* It is the sense of Congress that—

  * (1) in negotiations at the Food Aid Convention, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and other appropriate venues, the President shall—

    * (A) seek commitments of higher levels of food aid by donors in order to meet the legitimate needs of developing countries;

    * (B) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that humanitarian nongovernmental organizations, recipient country governments, charitable bodies, and international organizations shall continue—

      * (i) to be eligible to receive resources based on assessments of need conducted by those organizations and entities; and

      * (ii) to implement food aid programs in agreements with donor countries; and


    * (C) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that options for providing food aid for emergency and nonemergency needs shall not be subject to limitation, including in-kind commodities, provision of funds for agricultural commodity procurement, and monetization of commodities, on the condition that the provision of those commodities or funds—

      * (i) is based on assessments of need and intended to benefit the food security of, or otherwise assist, recipients, and

      * (ii) is provided in a manner that avoids disincentives to local agricultural production and marketing and with minimal potential for disruption of commercial markets; and


  * (2) the United States should increase its contribution of bona fide food assistance to developing countries consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture.
