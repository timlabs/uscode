### **CHAPTER 39—STABILIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL WHEAT MARKET**

### §1641. Availability of wheat for export; utilization of funds and facilities; prices; authorization of appropriations
* The President is authorized, acting through the Commodity Credit Corporation, to make available or cause to be made available, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, such quantities of wheat and wheat-flour and at such prices as are necessary to exercise the rights, obtain the benefits, and fulfill the obligations of the United States under the International Wheat Agreement of 1949 signed by Australia, Canada, France, the United States, Uruguay, and certain wheat importing countries, along with the agreements signed by the United States and certain other countries revising and renewing such agreement of 1949 for periods through July 31, 1965 (hereinafter collectively called the "International Wheat Agreement"). Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude the Secretary of Agriculture, in carrying out programs to encourage the exportation of agricultural commodities and products thereof pursuant to section 612c of this title, from utilizing funds available for such programs in such manner as, either separately or jointly with the Commodity Credit Corporation, to exercise the rights, obtain the benefits, and fulfill all or any part of the obligations of the United States under the International Wheat Agreement or to preclude the Commodity Credit Corporation in otherwise carrying out wheat and wheat-flour export programs as authorized by law. Nothing contained in this chapter shall limit the duty of the Commodity Credit Corporation to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the Corporation's purposes and the effective and efficient conduct of its business to utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce in making available or causing to be made available wheat and wheat-flour under this chapter. The pricing provisions of section 1510(e) of title 22 and section 713a–9 of title 15, shall not be applicable to domestic wheat and wheat-flour supplied to countries which are parties to the International Wheat Agreement and credited to their guaranteed purchases thereunder on and after August 1, 1949, and up to and including June 30, 1950. Where prices in excess of the International Wheat Agreement prices have been paid for such wheat and wheat-flour financed by the Economic Cooperation Administration on or after August 1, 1949, and up to and including June 30, 1950, the Secretary of Agriculture or Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to reimburse the Economic Cooperation Administration for such excess amounts. Funds realized from such reimbursement shall revert to the respective appropriation or appropriations from which funds were expended for the procurement of such wheat and wheat-flour. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to make payments to the Commodity Credit Corporation of its estimated or actual net costs of carrying out its functions hereunder. Such net costs in connection with the International Wheat Agreement, 1959, shall include those with respect to all transactions which qualify as commercial purchases (as defined in such agreement) from the United States by importing member countries. Such net costs in connection with the International Wheat Agreement, 1962, shall include those with respect to all transactions which qualify as commercial purchases (as defined in such agreement) from the United States by member and provisional member importing countries, including transactions entered into prior to the deposit of instruments of acceptance or accession by any of the countries involved, if the loading period is not earlier than the date the agreement enters into force. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized in carrying out its functions under this chapter to utilize, in advance of such appropriations or payments, any assets available to it.

Such information shall be reported and such records shall be kept in accordance with such regulations as the President may prescribe. For the purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any report made or record kept, or of obtaining information required to be furnished in any report, but not so furnished, the President is authorized to examine such books, papers, records, accounts, correspondence, contracts, documents, and memoranda as are relevant to transactions under the International Wheat Agreement and are within the control of any such person.

#### (d) Forfeiture for excessive exports or imports

#### (e) Jurisdiction and venue of actions; remedies, fines, and forfeitures as additional

Any criminal proceeding may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or rules and regulations thereunder, or to enjoin any violation of such chapter or rules and regulations, may be brought in any such district wherein the defendant is found or is a resident or transacts business. The remedies, fines, and forfeitures provided for in this chapter shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any of the remedies, fines, and forfeitures under existing law.
