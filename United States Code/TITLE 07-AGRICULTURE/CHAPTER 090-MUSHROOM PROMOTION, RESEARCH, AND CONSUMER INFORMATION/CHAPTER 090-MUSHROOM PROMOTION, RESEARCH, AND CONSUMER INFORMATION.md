### **CHAPTER 90—MUSHROOM PROMOTION, RESEARCH, AND CONSUMER INFORMATION**

### §6101. Findings and declaration of policy
#### (a) Findings
* Congress finds that—

  * (1) mushrooms are an important food that is a valuable part of the human diet;

  * (2) the production of mushrooms plays a significant role in the Nation's economy in that mushrooms are produced by hundreds of mushroom producers, distributed through thousands of wholesale and retail outlets, and consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries;

  * (3) mushroom production benefits the environment by efficiently using agricultural byproducts;

  * (4) mushrooms must be high quality, readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the benefits of this important product are available to the people of the United States;

  * (5) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and uses, and the development of new markets and uses, for mushrooms are vital to the welfare of producers and those concerned with marketing and using mushrooms, as well as to the agricultural economy of the Nation;

  * (6) the cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated program of mushroom promotion, research, and consumer information are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets for mushrooms; and

  * (7) mushrooms move in interstate and foreign commerce, and mushrooms that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in mushrooms.

#### (b) Policy
* It is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided in this chapter, of an orderly procedure for developing, financing through adequate assessments on mushrooms produced domestically or imported into the United States, and carrying out, an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of promotion, research, and consumer and industry information designed to—
