### §1639b. Establishment of national bioengineered food disclosure standard
#### (a) Establishment of mandatory standard
* Not later than 2 years after July 29, 2016, the Secretary shall—

  * (1) establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard with respect to any bioengineered food and any food that may be bioengineered; and

  * (2) establish such requirements and procedures as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out the standard.

#### (b) Regulations
* #### (1) In general
  * A food may bear a disclosure that the food is bioengineered only in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter.

* #### (2) Requirements
  * A regulation promulgated by the Secretary in carrying out this subchapter shall—

    * (A) prohibit a food derived from an animal to be considered a bioengineered food solely because the animal consumed feed produced from, containing, or consisting of a bioengineered substance;

    * (B) determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food;

    * (C) establish a process for requesting and granting a determination by the Secretary regarding other factors and conditions under which a food is considered a bioengineered food;

    * (D) in accordance with subsection (d), require that the form of a food disclosure under this section be a text, symbol, or electronic or digital link, but excluding Internet website Uniform Resource Locators not embedded in the link, with the disclosure option to be selected by the food manufacturer;

    * (F) in the case of small food manufacturers, provide—

      * (i) an implementation date that is not earlier than 1 year after the implementation date for regulations promulgated in accordance with this section; and

      * (ii) on-package disclosure options, in addition to those available under subparagraph (D), to be selected by the small food manufacturer, that consist of—

  * For the purpose of regulations promulgated and food disclosures made pursuant to paragraph (2), a bioengineered food that has successfully completed the pre-market Federal regulatory review process shall not be treated as safer than, or not as safe as, a non-bioengineered counterpart of the food solely because the food is bioengineered or produced or developed with the use of bioengineering.

#### (c) Study of electronic or digital link disclosure
* #### (1) In general
  * Not later than 1 year after July 29, 2016, the Secretary shall conduct a study to identify potential technological challenges that may impact whether consumers would have access to the bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods.

* #### (2) Public comments
  * In conducting the study under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall solicit and consider comments from the public.

* #### (3) Factors
