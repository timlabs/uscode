  * Subject to any applicable Federal law relating to the devise or descent of trust or restricted land, no heir by killing shall in any way acquire any trust or restricted interests in land or interests in trust personalty as the result of the death of the decedent, but such property shall pass in accordance with this subsection.

* #### (3) Descent, distribution, and right of survivorship

  * (B) As to trust or restricted land or trust personalty held jointly by 3 or more persons, including both the heir by killing and the decedent, any income which would have accrued to the heir by killing as a result of the death of the decedent shall pass to the estate of the decedent as if the heir by killing had predeceased the decedent and any surviving joint tenants.

  * (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the decedent's trust or restricted interest in land or trust personalty that is held in a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship shall be severed from the joint tenancy as though the property held in the joint tenancy were to be severed and distributed equally among the joint tenants and the decedent's interest shall pass to his estate; the remainder of the interests shall remain in joint tenancy with right of survivorship among the surviving joint tenants.

* #### (5) Life estate for the life of another
  * If the estate is held by a third person whose possession expires upon the death of the decedent, it shall remain in such person's hands for the period of time following the decedent's death equal to the life expectancy of the decedent but for the killing.

* #### (6) Preadjudication rule
  * #### (A) In general
    * If a person has been charged, whether by indictment, information, or otherwise by the United States, a tribe, or any State, with voluntary manslaughter or homicide in connection with a decedent's death, then any and all trust or restricted land or trust personalty that would otherwise pass to that person from the decedent's estate shall not pass or be distributed by the Secretary until the charges have been resolved in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

    * Upon dismissal or withdrawal of the charge, or upon a verdict of not guilty, such land and personalty shall pass as if no charge had been filed or made.

    * #### (i) In general
      * If, after executing a will, a testator is divorced or the marriage of the testator is annulled, as of the effective date of the divorce or annulment, any disposition of trust or restricted interests in land or of trust personalty made by the will to the former spouse of the testator shall be considered to be revoked unless the will expressly provides otherwise.

  * (B) For the purposes of this section, trust personalty advanced during the decedent's lifetime is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of the decedent's death, whichever occurs first.

  * (C) If the recipient of the trust personalty predeceases the decedent, the property shall not be treated as an advancement or taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate unless the decedent's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

* #### (6) Heirs related to decedent through 2 lines; single share
  * A person who is related to the decedent through 2 lines of relationship is entitled to only a single share of the trust or restricted land or trust personalty in the decedent's estate based on the relationship that would entitle such person to the larger share.
