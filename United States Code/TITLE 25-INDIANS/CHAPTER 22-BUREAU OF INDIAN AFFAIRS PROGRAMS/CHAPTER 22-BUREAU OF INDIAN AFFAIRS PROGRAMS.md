#### (b) Grants; effect upon appropriated amounts
* #### (1) Grants
  * Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school or grant school in the amount determined under this section with respect to the tribe or tribal organization for the purpose of paying the administrative and indirect costs incurred in operating contract or grant schools, provided that no school operated as a stand-alone institution shall receive less than $200,000 per year for these purposes, in order to—

#### (d) Administrative cost percentage rate
* #### (1) In general
  * For purposes of this section, the administrative cost percentage rate for a contract or grant school for a fiscal year is equal to the percentage determined by dividing—

    * (A) the sum of—

      * (i) the amount equal to—

        * (I) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, multiplied by

        * (II) the minimum base rate; plus


      * (ii) the amount equal to—

        * (I) the standard direct cost base; multiplied by

#### (i) Studies for determination of factors affecting costs; base rates limits; standard direct cost base; report to Congress
* #### (1) Studies
  * Not later than 120 days after January 8, 2002, the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs shall—

    * (A) conduct such studies as may be needed to establish an empirical basis for determining relevant factors substantially affecting required administrative costs of tribal elementary and secondary education programs, using the formula set forth in subsection (c); and

    * (B) conduct a study to determine—

      * (i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs;

      * (ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs; and

      * (iii) a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (d) will—

        * (I) be equal to the median between the maximum base rate and the minimum base rate; and

        * (II) ensure that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs closest to the size of the program.

* #### (2) Guidelines
  * The studies required under paragraph (1) shall—

    * (A) be conducted in full consultation (in accordance with section 2011 of this title) with—

      * (i) the tribes and tribal organizations that are affected by the application of the formula set forth in subsection (c); and

    * (B) be conducted onsite with a representative statistical sample of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs under a contract entered into with a nationally reputable public accounting and business consulting firm;

    * (C) take into account the availability of skilled labor commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found to substantially affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to ensure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;

    * (D) identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and

    * (E) identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.

* #### (3) Consultation with Inspector General
  * In carrying out the studies required under this subsection, the Director shall obtain the input of, and afford an opportunity to participate to, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.

* #### (4) Consideration of delivery of administrative services
  * Determinations described in paragraph (2)(C) shall be based on what is practicable at each location studied, given prudent management practice, irrespective of whether required administrative services were actually or fully delivered at these sites, or whether other services were delivered instead, during the period of the study.

* #### (5) Report
  * Upon completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the studies, together with determinations based upon such studies that would affect the definitions set forth under subsection (e) that are used in the formula set forth in subsection (c).

* #### (6) Projection of costs
  * The Secretary shall include in the Bureau's justification for each appropriations request beginning in the first fiscal year after the completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), a projection of the overall costs associated with the formula set forth in subsection (c) for all tribal elementary or secondary education programs which the Secretary expects to be funded in the fiscal year for which the appropriations are sought.

* #### (7) Determination of program size
  * For purposes of this subsection, the size of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs is determined by the aggregate direct cost program funding level for all Bureau-funded programs which share common administrative cost functions.

#### (j) Authorization of appropriations
* #### (1) In general
  * There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary.

* #### (2) Reductions
  * If the total amount of funds necessary to provide grants to tribes and tribal organizations in the amounts determined under subsection (c) for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of funds appropriated to carry out this section for such fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of each grant determined under subsection (c) for such fiscal year by an amount that bears the same relationship to such excess as the amount of such grants determined under subsection (c) bears to the total of all grants determined under subsection (c) section for all tribes and tribal organizations for such fiscal year.
