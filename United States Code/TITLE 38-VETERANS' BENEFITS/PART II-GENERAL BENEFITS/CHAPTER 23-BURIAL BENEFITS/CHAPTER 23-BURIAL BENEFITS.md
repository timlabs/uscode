* (c) With respect to any fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide a percentage increase (rounded to the nearest dollar) in the maximum amount of burial and funeral expenses payable under subsection (a) and in the maximum amount of the plot or interment allowance payable under subsection (b), equal to the percentage by which—

  * (1) the Consumer Price Index (all items, United States city average) for the 12-month period ending on the June 30 preceding the beginning of the fiscal year for which the increase is made, exceeds

### §2304. Claims for reimbursement
* Applications for payments under section 2302 of this title must be filed within two years after the burial of the veteran. If the burial allowance was not payable at the death of the veteran because of the nature of the veteran's discharge from the service, but after the veteran's death the veteran's discharge has been corrected by competent authority so as to reflect a discharge from the service under conditions other than dishonorable, then the burial allowance may be paid if a claim is filed within two years from the date of correction of the discharge. If a claimant's application is incomplete at the time it is originally submitted, the Secretary shall notify the applicant of the evidence necessary to complete the application. If such evidence is not received within one year from the date of such notification, no allowance may be paid.

### §2305. Persons eligible under prior law
* The death of any person who had a status which would, under the laws in effect on December 31, 1957, afford entitlement to the burial benefits and other benefits provided for in this chapter, but who did not meet the service requirements contained in this chapter, shall afford entitlement to such benefits, notwithstanding the failure of such person to meet such service requirements.
