### SUBCHAPTER II—DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION

### §1310. Deaths entitling survivors to dependency and indemnity compensation
* (a) When any veteran dies after December 31, 1956, from a service-connected or compensable disability, the Secretary shall pay dependency and indemnity compensation to such veteran's surviving spouse, children, and parents. The standards and criteria for determining whether or not a disability is service-connected shall be those applicable under chapter 11 of this title.

* (b) Dependency and indemnity compensation shall not be paid to the surviving spouse, children, or parents of any veteran dying after December 31, 1956, unless such veteran (1) was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from the period of active military, naval, air, or space service in which the disability causing such veteran's death was incurred or aggravated, or (2) died while in the active military, naval, air, or space service.

* (c) A person who receives a payment under the provisions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 2210 note) shall not be deprived, by reason of the receipt of that payment, of receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation to which that person is otherwise entitled, but there shall be deducted from payment of such dependency and indemnity compensation the amount of the payment under that Act.

### §1311. Dependency and indemnity compensation to a surviving spouse
* (a)(1) Dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to a surviving spouse at the monthly rate of $1,154.

* (2) The rate under paragraph (1) shall be increased by $246 in the case of the death of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive (or but for the receipt of retired pay or retirement pay was entitled to receive) compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. In determining the period of a veteran's disability for purposes of the preceding sentence, only periods in which the veteran was married to the surviving spouse shall be considered.

* (3) In the case of dependency and indemnity compensation paid to a surviving spouse that is predicated on the death of a veteran before January 1, 1993, the monthly rate of such compensation shall be the amount based on the pay grade of such veteran, as set forth in the following table, if the amount is greater than the total amount determined with respect to that veteran under paragraphs (1) and (2):

  | Pay grade | Monthly rate | Pay grade | Monthly rate |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |

* <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;If the veteran served as Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, or Commandant of the Coast Guard, at the applicable time designated by section 1302 of this title, the surviving spouse's rate shall be $2,643.

* (d) The monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation payable to a surviving spouse shall be increased by $135 if the surviving spouse is, by reason of disability, permanently housebound but does not qualify for the aid and attendance allowance under subsection (c) of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the requirement of "permanently housebound" will be considered to have been met when the surviving spouse is substantially confined to such surviving spouse's home (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of a disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such surviving spouse's lifetime.

* (e) In the case of an individual who is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation under this section by reason of section 103(d)(2)(B) of this title who is also eligible for benefits under another provision of law by reason of such individual's status as the surviving spouse of a veteran, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than section 5304(b)(3) of this title), no reduction in benefits under such other provision of law shall be made by reason of such individual's eligibility for benefits under this section.

* (f)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if there is a surviving spouse with one or more children below the age of 18, the dependency and indemnity compensation paid monthly to the surviving spouse shall be increased by $250 (as increased from time to time under paragraph (4)), regardless of the number of such children.

* (2) Dependency and indemnity compensation shall be increased under this subsection only for months occurring during the two-year period beginning on the date on which entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation commenced.

* (3) The increase in dependency and indemnity compensation of a surviving spouse under this subsection shall cease beginning with the first month commencing after the month in which all children of the surviving spouse have attained the age of 18.

* (4) Whenever there is an increase in benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) as a result of a determination made under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)), the Secretary shall, effective on the date of such increase in benefit amounts, increase the amount payable under paragraph (1), as such amount was in effect immediately prior to the date of such increase in benefit amounts, by the same percentage as the percentage by which such benefit amounts are increased. Any increase in a dollar amount under this paragraph shall be rounded down to the next lower whole dollar amount.

* (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation under this subsection is in addition to any other dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this chapter.

### §1312. Benefits in certain cases of in-service or service-connected deaths

  * (1) who dies after December 31, 1956, and is not a fully and currently insured individual (as defined in section 214 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 414)) at the time of such veteran's death; and

  * (2) whose death occurs—

    * (A) while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training; or

* the Secretary shall pay for such month benefits under this section to each such survivor in an amount equal to the amount of the benefits which would have been paid for such month to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), if such veteran had been both fully and currently insured at the time of such veteran's death and if such survivor had filed application therefor on the same date on which application for benefits under this section is filed with the Secretary.

* (b) In any case where the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this chapter to a surviving spouse who has children is less than the amount of pension which would be payable to (1) such surviving spouse, or (2) such children if the surviving spouse were not entitled, under chapter 15 of this title had the death occurred under circumstances authorizing payment of death pension, the Secretary shall pay dependency and indemnity compensation to such surviving spouse in an amount equal to such amount of pension.

### §1313. Dependency and indemnity compensation to children

  * (4) more than three children, $915, plus $174 for each child in excess of three.


* (b) If dependency and indemnity compensation has been awarded under this section to a veteran's child or children and the entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation under this section of an additional child of that veteran who is over the age of eighteen years and who had previously been entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation under this section before becoming eighteen years of age is later reestablished effective retroactively upon determination that such child is pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution, the amount payable retroactively to the additional child is the amount equal to the difference between the total of the increased award payable under this section to the children of the deceased veteran for the retroactive period and the prior total award for such purpose for that period.

### §1314. Supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation to children
* (a) In the case of a child entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation who has attained the age of eighteen and who, while under such age, became permanently incapable of self-support, the dependency and indemnity compensation paid monthly to such child shall be increased by $286.

* (b) If dependency and indemnity compensation is payable monthly to a person as a surviving spouse and there is a child (of such person's deceased spouse) who has attained the age of eighteen and who, while under such age, became permanently incapable of self-support, dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid monthly to each such child, concurrently with the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation to the surviving spouse, in the amount of $488.

* (c) If dependency and indemnity compensation is payable monthly to a person as a surviving spouse and there is a child (of such person's deceased spouse), who has attained the age of eighteen and who, while under the age of twenty-three, is pursuing a course of instruction at an educational institution approved under section 104 of this title, dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid monthly to each such child, concurrently with the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation to the surviving spouse, in the amount of $243.

In such a case of remarriage the total combined annual income of the parent and such parent's spouse shall be counted in determining the monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation under the appropriate formula.

* (c)(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, if there are two parents, but they are not living together, the monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation paid to each such parent shall be $412, as increased from time to time under section 5312(b)(1) of this title and reduced by an amount, based upon the amount of such parent's annual income, determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe under section 5312(b)(2) of this title.

* (e) For purposes of sections 1448(d) and 1450(c) of title 10, eligibility for benefits under this chapter by virtue of this section shall be deemed eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation under section 1311(a) of this title.
