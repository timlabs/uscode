* (f)(1) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in subclause (A)(ii) or (B)(ii) of subsection (a)(9) of this section, the purchase of (or the refinancing of a loan secured by) the manufactured home and the lot for that home shall be considered as one loan and must comply with such criteria as may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations.

* (4)(A) Any lender making a loan under this chapter shall certify, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the lender has complied with the credit information and loan processing standards established under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and that, to the best of the lender's knowledge and belief, the loan meets the underwriting standards established under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.

### §3711. Direct loans to veterans
* (a) The Congress finds that housing credit for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title is not and has not been generally available to veterans living in rural areas, or in small cities and towns not near large metropolitan areas. It is therefore the purpose of this section to provide housing credit for veterans living in such rural areas and such small cities and towns.

* (b) Whenever the Secretary finds that private capital is not generally available in any rural area or small city or town for the financing of loans guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, the Secretary shall designate such rural area or small city or town as a "housing credit shortage area". The Secretary shall, with respect to any such area, make, or enter into commitments to make, to any veteran eligible under this title, a loan for any or all of the purposes described in section 3710(a) or 3712 of this title (other than the refinancing of a loan under section 3710(a)(8) or 3712(a)(1)(F)).

* (c) No loan may be made under this section to a veteran unless the veteran shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

  * (1) the veteran is unable to obtain from a private lender in such housing credit shortage area, at an interest rate not in excess of the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, a loan for such purpose for which the veteran is qualified under section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate; and

  * (2) the veteran is unable to obtain a loan for such purpose from the Secretary of Agriculture under title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).


* (d)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, not to exceed the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans, or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as may be applicable.

* (2)(A) Except for any loan made under this chapter for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title, the original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under section 3710 of this title at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000; and the guaranty entitlement of any veteran who heretofore or hereafter has been granted a loan under this section shall be charged with an amount which bears the same ratio to $36,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.

* (B) The original principal amount of any loan made under this section for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title shall not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under such section at the time the loan is made bears to $20,000. The amount of the guaranty entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title of any veteran who is granted a loan under this section, or who before October 18, 1978, was granted a loan under this section, shall be charged with the amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.

* (3) No veteran may obtain loans under this section aggregating more than $33,000.

* (e) Loans made under this section shall be repaid in monthly installments, except that in the case of any such loan made for any of the purposes described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may provide that such loan shall be repaid in quarterly, semiannual, or annual installments.

* (f) In connection with any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to pay taxes and assessments on the real estate, to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements, and to meet the incidental expenses of the transaction. The Secretary shall determine the expenses incident to origination of loans made under this section, which expenses, or a reasonable flat allowance in lieu thereof, shall be paid by the veteran in addition to the loan closing costs.

* (g) The Secretary may sell, and shall offer for sale, to any person or entity approved for such purpose by the Secretary, any loan made under this section at a price which the Secretary determines to be reasonable under the conditions prevailing in the mortgage market when the agreement to sell the loan is made; and shall guarantee any loan thus sold subject to the same conditions, terms, and limitations which would be applicable were the loan guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate.

* (h) The Secretary may exempt dwellings constructed through assistance provided by this section from the minimum land planning and subdivision requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3704 of this title, and with respect to such dwellings may prescribe special minimum land planning and subdivision requirements which shall be in keeping with the general housing facilities in the locality but shall require that such dwellings meet minimum requirements of structural soundness and general acceptability.

* (i) The Secretary is authorized, without regard to the provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, to make or enter into a commitment to make a loan to any veteran to assist the veteran in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit authorized under chapter 21 of this title, if the veteran is determined to be eligible for the benefits of such chapter 21, and is eligible for loan guaranty benefits under this chapter.

* (j)(1) If any builder or sponsor proposes to construct one or more dwellings in a housing credit shortage area, or in any area for a veteran who is determined to be eligible for assistance in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit under chapter 21 of this title, the Secretary may enter into commitment with such builder or sponsor, under which funds available for loans under this section will be reserved for a period not in excess of three months, or such longer period as the Secretary may authorize to meet the needs in any particular case, for the purpose of making loans to veterans to purchase such dwellings. Such commitment may not be assigned or transferred except with the written approval of the Secretary. The Secretary shall not enter into any such commitment unless such builder or sponsor pays a nonrefundable commitment fee to the Secretary in an amount determined by the Secretary, not to exceed 2 percent of the funds reserved for such builder or sponsor.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary finds that a dwelling with respect to which funds are being reserved under this subsection has been sold, or contracted to be sold, to a veteran eligible for a direct loan under this section, the Secretary shall enter into a commitment to make the veteran a loan for the purchase of such dwelling. With respect to any loan made to an eligible veteran under this subsection, the Secretary may make advances during the construction of the dwelling, up to a maximum in advances of (A) the cost of the land plus (B) 80 percent of the value of the construction in place.

* (k) Without regard to any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may take or cause to be taken such action as in the Secretary's judgment may be necessary or appropriate for or in connection with the custody, management, protection, and realization or sale of investments under this section, may determine the Secretary's necessary expenses and expenditures, and the manner in which the same shall be incurred, allowed and paid, may make such rules, regulations, and orders as the Secretary may deem necessary or appropriate for carrying out the Secretary's functions under this section and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, may employ, utilize, compensate, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the Secretary's basic responsibilities under this chapter, delegate any of the Secretary's functions under this section to such persons and such corporate or other agencies, including agencies of the United States, as the Secretary may designate.

* (3) Any loan made for the purposes described in clause (C), (E), or (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered as part of one loan. The transaction may be evidenced by a single loan instrument or by separate loan instruments for (A) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the manufactured home, and (B) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the lot and the necessary preparation of such lot.

    * (II) must have previously occupied the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, securing the loan as the veteran's home and must certify, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that the veteran has previously so occupied the home (or such a home on the lot); or

    * (III) in any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as a home because of such status, the spouse of the veteran must occupy, or must have previously occupied, the manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as such spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.

For purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.

  * (ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.


* (E) In any accounting filed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall permit to be included therein accrued unpaid interest from the date of the first uncured default to such cutoff date as the Secretary may establish, and the Secretary shall allow the holder of the loan to charge against the liquidation or resale proceeds accrued interest from the cutoff date established to such further date as the Secretary may determine and such costs and expenses as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and proper.

* (F) The liability of the United States under the guaranty provided for by this paragraph shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the obligation.

* (4) The maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to a veteran for purposes specified in this section shall be $20,000 reduced by the amount of any such entitlement previously used by the veteran. Use of entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3711 of this title shall reduce entitlement available for use for purposes specified in this section to the same extent that entitlement available for purposes specified in such section 3710 is reduced below $20,000.

* (5) The amount of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not exceed an amount equal to 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan.

* (d)(1) The maturity of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not be more than—

  * (A) fifteen years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of a lot;

  * (B) twenty years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of—

    * (i) a single-wide manufactured home; or

    * (ii) a single-wide manufactured home and a lot;

  * (D) twenty-five years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of a double-wide manufactured home and a lot.


* (2) Nothing in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall preclude the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, from consenting to necessary advances for the protection of the security or the holder's lien, to a reasonable extension of the term of such loan, or to a reasonable reamortization of such loan.

* (e) No loan shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless—

  * (1) the loan is repayable in approximately equal monthly installments;

  * (2) the terms of repayment bear a proper relationship to the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, as determined in accordance with the regulations prescribed under section 3710(g) of this title and taking into account the purpose of this program to make available lower cost housing to low and lower income veterans, especially those who have been recently discharged or released from active military, naval, or air service, who may not have previously established credit ratings;

  * (3) the loan is secured by a first lien on the manufactured home purchased with the proceeds of the loan and on any lot acquired or improved with the proceeds of the loan;

  * (4) the amount of the loan to be paid by the veteran is not in excess of the amount determined to be reasonable, based upon—

    * (A) with respect to any portion of the loan to purchase a new manufactured home, such cost factors as the Secretary considers proper to take into account;

  * (5) the veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the veteran will personally occupy the property as the veteran's home; except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply (A) in the case of a guaranteed loan that is for the purpose described in paragraph (1)(F) of subsection (a), or (B) in the case described in section 3704(c)(2);

  * (6) the manufactured home is or will be placed on a site which meets specifications which the Secretary shall establish by regulation; and

  * (7) the interest rate to be charged on the loan does not exceed the permissible rate established by the Secretary.


* (f) The Secretary shall establish such rate of interest for manufactured home loans and manufactured home lot loans as the Secretary determines to be necessary in order to assure a reasonable supply of manufactured home loan financing for veterans for purposes specified in this section.

* (g) The Secretary shall promulgate such regulations as the Secretary determines to be necessary or appropriate in order to fully implement the provisions of this section, and such regulations may specify which provisions in other sections of this chapter the Secretary determines should be applicable to loans guaranteed or made for purposes specified in this section. The Secretary shall have such powers and responsibilities in respect to matters arising under this section as the Secretary has in respect to loans made or guaranteed or under other sections of this chapter.

* (h)(1) No loan for the purchase of a manufactured home shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless the manufactured home and lot, if any, meet or exceed standards for planning, construction, and general acceptability as prescribed by the Secretary and no loan for the purchase of a lot on which to place a manufactured home owned by a veteran shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless the lot meets such standards prescribed for manufactured home lots. Such standards shall be designed to encourage the maintenance and development of sites for manufactured homes which will be attractive residential areas and which will be free from, and not substantially contribute to, adverse scenic or environmental conditions.

* (2) Any manufactured housing unit properly displaying a certification of conformity to all applicable Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards pursuant to section 616 of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5415) shall be deemed to meet the standards required by paragraph (1).

* (i) The Secretary shall require the manufacturer to become a warrantor of any new manufactured home which is approved for purchase with financing through the assistance of this chapter and to furnish to the purchaser a written warranty in such form as the Secretary shall require. Such warranty shall include (1) a specific statement that the manufactured home meets the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section; and (2) a provision that the warrantor's liability to the purchaser or owner is limited under the warranty to instances of substantial nonconformity to such standards which become evident within one year from date of purchase and as to which the purchaser or owner gives written notice to the warrantor not later than ten days after the end of the warranty period. The warranty prescribed herein shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and privileges which such purchaser or owner may have under any other law or instrument and shall so provide in the warranty document.

* (j) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary is authorized to deny guaranteed or direct loan financing in the case of—

  * (1) manufactured homes constructed by a manufacturer who fails or is unable to discharge the manufacturer's obligations under the warranty;

  * (2) manufactured homes which are determined by the Secretary not to conform to the standards provided for in subsection (h); or

  * (3) a manufacturer of manufactured homes who has engaged in procedures or practices determined by the Secretary to be unfair or prejudicial to veterans or the Government.


* (k) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary may refuse to approve as acceptable any site in a manufactured home park or subdivision owned or operated by any person whose rental or sale methods, procedures, requirements, or practices are determined by the Secretary to be unfair or prejudicial to veterans renting or purchasing such sites. The Secretary may also refuse to guarantee or make direct loans for veterans to purchase manufactured homes offered for sale by any dealer if substantial deficiencies have been discovered in such homes, or if the Secretary determines that there has been a failure or indicated inability of the dealer to discharge contractual liabilities to veterans, or that the type of contract of sale or methods, procedures, or practices pursued by the dealer in the marketing of such properties have been unfair or prejudicial to veteran purchasers.

* (l) The provisions of sections 3704(d) and 3721 of this title shall be fully applicable to lenders making guaranteed manufactured home loans and manufactured home lot loans and holders of such loans.

### §3713. Release from liability under guaranty
* (a) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran and by the transferee incident to such disposal, shall issue to such veteran in connection with such disposal a release relieving the veteran of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as the Secretary may deem appropriate, that (1) the loan is current, and (2) the purchaser of such property from such veteran (A) is obligated by contract to purchase such property and to assume full liability for the repayment of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid, and has assumed by contract all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and securing the loan, and (B) qualifies from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the transferee were a veteran eligible for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title, for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation for which the transferee has assumed liability.

* (b) If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran under this chapter without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under subsection (a), and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines, after such investigation as the Secretary deems appropriate, that the property was disposed of by the veteran in such a manner, and subject to such conditions, that the Secretary would have issued the veteran a release from liability under subsection (a) with respect to the loan if the veteran had made application therefor incident to such disposal. Failure of a transferee to assume by contract all of the liabilities of the original veteran-borrower shall bar such release of liability only in cases in which no acceptable transferee, either immediate or remote, is legally liable to the Secretary for the indebtedness of the original veteran-borrower arising from termination of the loan. The failure of a veteran to qualify for release from liability under this subsection does not preclude relief from being granted under section 5302(b) of this title, if the veteran is eligible for relief under that section.

* (c) This section shall apply only to loans for which commitments are made before March 1, 1988.

### §3714. Assumptions; release from liability
* (a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, if a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter and the veteran or other person notifies the holder of the loan in writing before the property is disposed of, the veteran or other person, as the case may be, shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that—

  * (A) the loan is current; and

  * (B) the purchaser of the property from such veteran or other person—

    * (i) is obligated by contract to purchase such property and to assume full liability for the repayment of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid and has assumed by contract all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and securing the loan; and

    * (ii) qualifies from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the purchaser were a veteran eligible under section 3710 of this title, for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation for which the purchaser is to assume liability.


* (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), paragraph (3), and paragraph (4)(C)(ii) of this subsection, the Secretary shall be considered to be the holder of the loan if the actual holder is not an approved lender described in section 3702.

* (3) If the holder of the loan determines that the loan is not current or that the purchaser of the property does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the holder shall—

  * (A) notify the transferor and the Secretary of such determination; and

  * (B) notify the transferor that the transferor may appeal the determination to the Secretary.


* (4)(A) Upon the appeal of the transferor after a determination described in paragraph (3) is made, the Secretary shall, in a timely manner, review and make a determination (or a redetermination in any case in which the Secretary made the determination described in such paragraph) with respect to whether the loan is current and whether the purchaser of the property meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Secretary shall transmit, in writing, a notice of the nature of such determination to the transferor and the holder and shall inform them of the action that shall or may be taken under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as a result of the determination of the Secretary.

* (B)(i) If the Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the loan is current and that the purchaser meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the holder shall approve the assumption of the loan, and the transferor shall be relieved of all liability to the Secretary with respect to such loan.

* (ii) If the Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the purchaser does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary may direct the holder to approve the assumption of the loan if—

  * (I) the Secretary determines that the transferor of the property is unable to make payments on the loan and has made reasonable efforts to find a buyer who meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection and that, as a result, the proposed transfer is in the best interests of the Department and the transferor;

  * (II) the transferor has requested, within 15 days after receiving the notice referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, that the Secretary approve the assumption; and

  * (III) the transferor will, upon assumption of the loan by the purchaser, be secondarily liable on the loan.


* (C) If—

  * (i) the loan is not approved for assumption under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (1) of this subsection; or

  * (ii) no appeal is made by the transferor under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph within 30 days after the holder informs the transferor of its determination under paragraph (3) of this subsection,


* the holder may demand immediate, full payment of the principal, and all interest earned thereon, of such loan if the transferor disposes of the property.

* (b) If a person disposes of residential property described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person fails to notify the holder of the loan before the property is disposed of, the holder, upon learning of such action by the person, may demand immediate and full payment of the principal, interest, and all other amounts owing under the terms of the loan.

* (c)(1) In any case in which the holder of a loan described in subsection (a)(1) of this section has knowledge of a person's disposing of residential property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary of such action.

* (2) If the holder fails to notify the Secretary in such a case, the holder shall be liable to the Secretary for any damage sustained by the Secretary as a result of the holder's failure, as determined at the time the Secretary is required to make payments in accordance with any insurance or guaranty provided by the Secretary with respect to the loan concerned.

* (d) With respect to a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter, the Secretary shall provide, by regulation, that at least one instrument evidencing either the loan or the mortgage or deed of trust therefor, shall conspicuously contain, in such form as the Secretary shall specify, a notice in substantially the following form: "This loan is not assumable without the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent".

* (e) The Secretary shall establish in regulations a reasonable amount as the maximum amount that a lender may charge for processing an application for a creditworthiness determination and assumption of a loan pursuant to this section. Such regulations shall establish requirements for the timely processing of applications for acceptance of assumptions.

* (f)(1) This section shall apply—

  * (A) in the case of loans other than loans to finance the purchase of real property described in section 3733(a)(1) of this title, only to loans for which commitments are made on or after March 1, 1988; and

  * (B) in the case of loans to finance the purchase of such property, only to loans which are closed after January 1, 1989.


* (2) This section shall not apply to a loan which the Secretary has sold without recourse.
