  * (A) 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and

  * (B) the first date during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition on which there is an insufficiency.


* (2) In this subsection, "insufficiency" means amount, if any, by which a claim against the debtor exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim.
