      * Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), the tariff treatment accorded at any time during the transition period to any article referred to in any of subparagraphs (B) through (F) of paragraph (1) that is a CBTPA originating good shall be identical to the tariff treatment that is accorded at such time under Annex 2–B of the USMCA to an article described in the same 8-digit subheading of the HTS that is a good of Mexico and is imported into the United States.

  * #### (B) Relationship to subsection (h) duty reductions
    * If at any time during the transition period the rate of duty that would (but for action taken under subparagraph (A)(i) in regard to such period) apply with respect to any article under subsection (h) is a rate of duty that is lower than the rate of duty resulting from such action, then such lower rate of duty shall be applied for the purposes of implementing such action.

        * (I) One credit shall be issued to a producer or an entity controlling production for every two square meter equivalents of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric that the producer or entity controlling production can demonstrate that it purchased for the manufacture in Haiti of articles like or similar to any article eligible for preferential treatment under subparagraph (A). The Secretary of Commerce shall, if requested by a producer or entity controlling production, create and maintain an account for such producer or entity controlling production, into which such credits shall be deposited.

        * (II) Such producer or entity controlling production may redeem credits issued under subclause (I) for earned import allowance certificates reflecting such number of earned credits as the producer or entity may request and has available.

        * (III) The Secretary of Commerce may require any textile mill or other entity located in the United States that exports to Haiti qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric to submit, upon such export or upon request, documentation, such as a Shipper's Export Declaration, to the Secretary of Commerce—

          * (aa) verifying that the qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric was exported to a producer in Haiti or to an entity controlling production; and

        * (IV) The Secretary of Commerce may require that a producer or entity controlling production submit documentation to verify purchases of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric.

        * (V) The Secretary of Commerce may make available to each person or entity identified in documentation submitted under subclause (III) or (IV) information contained in such documentation that relates to the purchase of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric involving such person or entity.

          * (aa) submissions by textile mills or other entities in the United States documenting exports of yarns wholly formed in the United States to countries described in paragraph (1)(B)(iii) for the manufacture of qualifying knit fabric; and

          * (bb) procedures imposed on producers or entities controlling production to allow the Secretary of Commerce to obtain and verify information relating to the production of qualifying knit fabric.

    * #### (iii) Qualifying woven fabric defined
      * For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "qualifying woven fabric" means fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States, except that—

        * (I) fabric otherwise eligible as qualifying woven fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric because the fabric contains nylon filament yarn to which section 2703(b)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of this title applies;

        * (II) fabric that would otherwise be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric because the fabric contains yarns not wholly formed in the United States shall not be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric if the total weight of all such yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of the fabric; and

        * (III) fabric otherwise eligible as qualifying woven fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying fabric because the fabric contains yarns covered by clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (5)(A).

        * (I) fabric or knit-to-shape components otherwise eligible as qualifying knit fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain nylon filament yarn to which section 2703(b)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of this title applies;

        * (II) fabric or knit-to-shape components that would otherwise be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain yarns not wholly formed in the United States shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric if the total weight of all such yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of the fabric or knit-to-shape components; and

        * (III) fabric or knit-to-shape components otherwise eligible as qualifying knit fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain yarns covered by clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (5)(A).

    * #### (ii) Penalties for other fraudulent information
      * The Secretary of Commerce may establish and impose penalties for the submission to the Secretary of Commerce of fraudulent information under the program established under subparagraph (B), other than a claim described in clause (i).

* #### (5) Short supply provision

      * (i) any fabric or yarn described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) was determined to be eligible for preferential treatment, or

      * (ii) any fabric or yarn described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) was designated as not being available in commercial quantities,
