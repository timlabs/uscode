In carrying out this section, such Federal agency or agencies may not consider visual or auditory material to fail to qualify as being of international educational character—

  * (2) because it might lend itself to misinterpretation, or to misrepresentation of the United States or other countries, or their people or institutions;

  * (3) because it is not representative, authentic, or accurate or does not represent the current state of factual knowledge of a subject or aspect of a subject unless the material contains widespread and gross misstatements of fact;

  * (4) because it does not augment international understanding and goodwill, unless its primary purpose or effect is not to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or an aspect of a subject and its content is not such as to maintain, increase, or diffuse knowledge; or

  * (5) because in the opinion of the agency the material is propaganda.


* Such Federal agency or agencies may not label as propaganda any material that receives a certificate of international educational character under this section and the Agreement.

### §2052. Assistance from other Federal agencies; facilities and personnel
