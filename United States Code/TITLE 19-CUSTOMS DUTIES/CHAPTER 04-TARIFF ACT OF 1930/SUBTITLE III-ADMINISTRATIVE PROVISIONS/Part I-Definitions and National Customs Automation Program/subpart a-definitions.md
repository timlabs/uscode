    * (II) limit the geographical area in which the merchandise may be resold, or

  * (i) commercial levels;

  * (ii) quantity levels;

  * (iii) the costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in paragraph (1); and

  * (B) Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually paid or payable that is made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller after the date of the importation of the merchandise into the United States shall be disregarded in determining the transaction value under paragraph (1).
