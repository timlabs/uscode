* #### (3) Testing by accredited laboratories
  * When requested by an importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry.

  * Testing procedures and methodologies used by the Customs Service, and information resulting from any testing conducted by the Customs Service, shall be made available as follows:

    * (A) Testing procedures and methodologies shall be made available upon request to any person unless the procedures or methodologies are—

      * (i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent related to such procedures or methodologies, or

      * (ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.


    * (B) Information resulting from testing shall be made available upon request to the importer of record and any agent thereof unless the information reveals information which is—

      * (i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent; or

      * (ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.

* #### (5) Miscellaneous provisions
  * For purposes of this subsection—

    * (A) any reference to a private laboratory includes a reference to a private gauger; and

    * (B) accreditation of private laboratories extends only to the performance of functions by such laboratories that are within the scope of those responsibilities for determinations of the elements relating to admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of imported merchandise that are vested in, or delegated to, the Customs Service.

* Except in the case of merchandise with respect to which the determination of admissibility is vested in an agency other than the Customs Service, the following apply:

  * Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to release or detain the merchandise. Merchandise which is not released within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained merchandise.

* #### (4) Seizure and forfeiture
  * If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.

* #### (5) Effect of failure to make determination
  * (A) The failure by the Customs Service to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for customs examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision of the Customs Service to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 1514(a)(4) of this title.

  * (B) For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest against the decision to exclude the merchandise which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day.

  * (C) Notwithstanding section 2639 of title 28, once an action respecting a detention is commenced, unless the Customs Service establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.
