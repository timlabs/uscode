### PART II—IMPOSITION OF ANTIDUMPING DUTIES

### §1673. Antidumping duties imposed
* If—

  * (1) the administering authority determines that a class or kind of foreign merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value, and

  * (2) the Commission determines that—

    * (A) an industry in the United States—

      * (i) is materially injured, or

      * (ii) is threatened with material injury, or


    * (B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,


* by reason of imports of that merchandise or by reason of sales (or the likelihood of sales) of that merchandise for importation,


* then there shall be imposed upon such merchandise an antidumping duty, in addition to any other duty imposed, in an amount equal to the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) for the merchandise. For purposes of this section and section 1673d(b)(1) of this title, a reference to the sale of foreign merchandise includes the entering into of any leasing arrangement regarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of the merchandise.

### §1673a. Procedures for initiating an antidumping duty investigation
#### (a) Initiation by administering authority
* #### (1) In general
  * An antidumping duty investigation shall be initiated whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title exist.

* #### (2) Cases involving persistent dumping
  * #### (A) Monitoring
    * The administering authority may establish a monitoring program with respect to imports of a class or kind of merchandise from any additional supplier country for a period not to exceed one year if—

      * (i) more than one antidumping order is in effect with respect to that class or kind of merchandise;

      * (ii) in the judgment of the administering authority there is reason to believe or suspect an extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping from one or more additional supplier countries; and

      * (iii) in the judgment of the administering authority this extraordinary pattern is causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic industry.

  * #### (B) Initiation of investigation
    * If during the period of monitoring referred to in subparagraph (A), the administering authority determines that there is sufficient information to initiate a formal investigation under this subsection regarding an additional supplier country, the administering authority shall immediately initiate such an investigation.

  * #### (C) Definition
    * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "additional supplier country" means a country regarding which no antidumping investigation is currently pending, and no antidumping duty order is currently in effect, with respect to imports of the class or kind of merchandise covered by subparagraph (A).

  * #### (D) Expeditious action
    * The administering authority and the Commission, to the extent practicable, shall expedite proceedings under this part undertaken as a result of a formal investigation initiated under subparagraph (B).

#### (b) Initiation by petition
* #### (1) Petition requirements
  * An antidumping proceeding shall be initiated whenever an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry, which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1673 of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations. The petition may be amended at such time, and upon such conditions, as the administering authority and the Commission may permit.

  * #### (B) Acceptance of communications
    * The administering authority shall not accept any unsolicited oral or written communication from any person other than an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title before the administering authority makes its decision whether to initiate an investigation, except as provided in subsection (c)(4)(D), and except for inquiries regarding the status of the administering authority's consideration of the petition.

  * #### (C) Nondisclosure of certain information
    * The administering authority and the Commission shall not disclose information with regard to any draft petition submitted for review and comment before it is filed under paragraph (1).

#### (c) Petition determination
* #### (1) In general
  * #### (A) Time for initial determination
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 20 days after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b), the administering authority shall—

      * (i) after examining, on the basis of sources readily available to the administering authority, the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the petition, determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, and

      * (ii) determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.

  * #### (B) Extension of time
    * In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting "a maximum of 40 days" for "20 days".

  * #### (C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked
    * If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of—

      * (i) an antidumping duty order or finding that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or

      * (ii) a suspended investigation that was terminated under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed,


  * the administering authority and the Commission shall, to the maximum extent practicable, expedite any investigation initiated under this section with respect to the petition.

* #### (2) Affirmative determinations
  * If the determinations under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) are affirmative, the administering authority shall initiate an investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value.

* #### (3) Negative determinations
  * If the determination under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is negative, the administering authority shall dismiss the petition, terminate the proceeding, and notify the petitioner in writing of the reasons for the determination.

* #### (4) Determination of industry support
  * #### (A) General rule
    * For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority shall determine that the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry, if—

      * (i) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for at least 25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, and

      * (ii) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.

  * #### (B) Certain positions disregarded
    * #### (i) Producers related to foreign producers
      * In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of an antidumping duty order.

    * #### (ii) Producers who are importers
      * The administering authority may disregard the position of domestic producers of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.

  * #### (C) Special rule for regional industries
    * If the petition alleges the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.

  * #### (D) Polling the industry
    * If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall—

      * (i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or

      * (ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.

  * #### (E) Comments by interested parties
    * Before the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, any person who would qualify as an interested party under section 1677(9) of this title if an investigation were initiated, may submit comments or information on the issue of industry support. After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.

* #### (5) "Domestic producers or workers" defined
  * For purposes of this subsection, the term "domestic producers or workers" means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1).

#### (d) Notification to Commission of determination
* The administering authority shall—

  * (1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c), and

  * (2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.

#### (e) Information regarding critical circumstances
* If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that—

  * (1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or

  * (2) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew, or should have known, that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value,


* the administering authority may request the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1673d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.

### §1673b. Preliminary determinations
#### (a) Determination by Commission of reasonable indication of injury
* #### (1) General rule
  * Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1673a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that—

    * (A) an industry in the United States—

      * (i) is materially injured, or

      * (ii) is threatened with material injury, or


    * (B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,


* by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible. If the Commission finds that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible or otherwise makes a negative determination under this paragraph, the investigation shall be terminated.

* #### (2) Time for Commission determination
  * The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)—

    * (A) in the case of a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title—

      * (i) within 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, or

    * (B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.

#### (b) Preliminary determination by administering authority
* #### (1) Period of antidumping duty investigation
  * #### (A) In general
    * Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 140 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than fair value.

  * #### (B) If certain short life cycle merchandise involved
    * If a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title, or an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, concerns short life cycle merchandise that is included in a product category established under section 1673h(a) of this title, subparagraph (A) shall be applied—

      * (i) by substituting "100 days" for "140 days" if manufacturers that are second offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, and

      * (ii) by substituting "80 days" for "140 days" if manufacturers that are multiple offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation.

  * #### (C) Definitions of offenders
    * For purposes of subparagraph (B)—

      * (i) The term "second offender" means a manufacturer that is specified in 2 affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is—

        * (I) specified in both such determinations, and

        * (II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).


      * (ii) The term "multiple offender" means a manufacturer that is specified in 3 or more affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is—

        * (II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).

* #### (2) Preliminary determination under waiver of verification
  * Within 75 days after the initiation of an investigation, the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 60 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a preliminary determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made within 90 days after the initiation of the investigation on the basis of the record established during the first 60 days after the investigation was initiated.

* #### (3) De minimis dumping margin
  * In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a weighted average dumping margin is de minimis if the administering authority determines that it is less than 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.

#### (c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases
* #### (1) In general
  * If—

    * (A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b)(1), or

    * (B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that—

      * (i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of—

        * (I) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,

        * (II) the novelty of the issues presented, or

        * (III) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated, and


      * (ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,


* then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b)(1) until not later than the 190th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title. No extension of a determination date may be made under this paragraph for any investigation in which a determination date provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) applies unless the petitioner submits written notice to the administering authority of its consent to the extension.

* #### (2) Notice of postponement
  * The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b)(1), if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement, and notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.

#### (d) Effect of determination by the administering authority
* If the preliminary determination of the administering authority under subsection (b) of this section is affirmative, the administering authority—

  * (1)(A) shall—

    * (i) determine an estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and

    * (ii) determine, in accordance with section 1673d(c)(5) of this title, an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated, and


  * (B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated weighted average dumping margin or the estimated all-others rate, whichever is applicable,

  * (2) shall order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of merchandise subject to the determination which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of—

    * (A) the date on which notice of the determination is published in the Federal Register, or

    * (B) the date that is 60 days after the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register, and


  * (3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.


* The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months, except that the administering authority may, at the request of exporters representing a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise, extend that 4-month period to not more than 6 months.

#### (e) Critical circumstances determinations
* #### (1) In general
  * If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that—

    * (A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or

    * (ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there was likely to be material injury by reason of such sales, and

    * (B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.


* The administering authority shall be treated as having made an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A) in any investigation to which subsection (b)(1)(B) is applied.

* #### (2) Suspension of liquidation
  * If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of—

    * (A) the date which is 90 days before the date on which the suspension of liquidation was first ordered, or

    * (B) the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register.

#### (f) Notice of determination
* Whenever the Commission or the administering authority makes a determination under this section, the Commission or the administering authority, as the case may be, shall notify the petitioner, and other parties to the investigation, and the Commission or the administering authority (whichever is appropriate) of its determination. The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.

#### (a) Termination of investigation upon withdrawal of petition
* #### (1) In general
  * #### (A) Withdrawal of petition
    * Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), an investigation under this part may be terminated by either the administering authority or the Commission, after notice to all parties to the investigation, upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner or by the administering authority if the investigation was initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title.

  * #### (B) Refiling of petition
    * If, within 3 months after the withdrawal of a petition under subparagraph (A), a new petition is filed seeking the imposition of duties on both the subject merchandise of the withdrawn petition and the subject merchandise from another country, the administering authority and the Commission may use in the investigation initiated pursuant to the new petition any records compiled in an investigation conducted pursuant to the withdrawn petition. This subparagraph applies only with respect to the first withdrawal of a petition.

* #### (2) Special rules for quantitative restriction agreements
  * #### (A) In general
    * Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by accepting an understanding or other kind of agreement to limit the volume of imports into the United States of the subject merchandise unless the administering authority is satisfied that termination on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.

  * #### (B) Public interest factors
    * In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest the administering authority shall take into account—

      * (i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of antidumping duties;

      * (ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and

      * (iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.

  * #### (C) Prior consultations
    * Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—

      * (i) potentially affected consuming industries; and

      * (ii) potentially affected producers and workers in the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including producers and workers not party to the investigation.

* #### (3) Limitation on termination by Commission
  * The Commission may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) before a preliminary determination is made by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title.

#### (b) Agreements to eliminate completely sales at less than fair value or to cease exports of merchandise
* The administering authority may suspend an investigation if the exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise agree—

  * (1) to cease exports of the merchandise to the United States within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended, or

  * (2) to revise their prices to eliminate completely any amount by which the normal value of the merchandise which is the subject of the agreement exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of that merchandise.

#### (c) Agreements eliminating injurious effect
* #### (1) General rule
  * If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement to revise prices from exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise into the United States, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of that merchandise and if—

    * (A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and

    * (B) for each entry of each exporter the amount by which the estimated normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) will not exceed 15 percent of the weighted average amount by which the estimated normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) for all less-than-fair-value entries of the exporter examined during the course of the investigation.

* #### (2) "Extraordinary circumstances" defined
  * #### (A) Extraordinary circumstances
    * For purposes of this subsection, the term "extraordinary circumstances" means circumstances in which—

* Where practicable, the administering authority shall provide to the exporters who would have been subject to the agreement the reasons for not accepting the agreement and, to the extent possible, an opportunity to submit comments thereon.

#### (e) Suspension of investigation procedure
* Before an investigation may be suspended under subsection (b) or (c) the administering authority shall—

  * (1) notify the petitioner of, and consult with the petitioner concerning, its intention to suspend the investigation, and notify other parties to the investigation and the Commission not less than 30 days before the date on which it suspends the investigation,

  * (2) provide a copy of the proposed agreement to the petitioner at the time of the notification, together with an explanation of how the agreement will be carried out and enforced, and of how the agreement will meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d) or (c) and (d), and

      * (ii) if the liquidation of entries of such merchandise was suspended pursuant to a previous affirmative preliminary determination in the same case with respect to such merchandise, that suspension of liquidation shall terminate, and

      * (iii) the administering authority shall refund any cash deposit and release any bond or other security deposited under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title.

  * #### (B) Other agreements
    * If the agreement accepted by the administering authority is an agreement described in subsection (c), the liquidation of entries of the subject merchandise shall be suspended under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, or, if the liquidation of entries of such merchandise was suspended pursuant to a previous affirmative preliminary determination in the same case, that suspension of liquidation shall continue in effect, subject to subsection (h)(3), but the security required under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title may be adjusted to reflect the effect of the agreement.

    * (B) will prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of the merchandise under investigation.

* #### (2) Failure of agreements
  * If the administering authority determines that an agreement accepted under this subsection no longer prevents the suppression or undercutting of domestic prices of merchandise manufactured in the United States, the provisions of subsection (i) shall apply.

  * If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1673b(e) of this title, shall also contain a finding of whether—

    * (A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or

    * (ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there would be material injury by reason of such sales, and

    * (B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,


* by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1). If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.

* #### (2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority

* #### (4) Certain additional findings
  * (A) COMMISSION STANDARD FOR RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.—

    * (i) IN GENERAL.—If the finding of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the antidumping duty order to be issued under section 1673e of this title.

    * (ii) FACTORS TO CONSIDER.—In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant—

      * (I) the timing and the volume of the imports,

      * (III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.


  * (B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.

#### (c) Effect of final determinations
* #### (1) Effect of affirmative determination by the administering authority

    * (C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, the administering authority shall order the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title.

* #### (2) Issuance of order; effect of negative determination
  * If the determinations of the administering authority and the Commission under subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are affirmative, then the administering authority shall issue an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title.

    * (A) terminate the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, and

    * (B) release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, required under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title.

    * (B) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was affirmative, but the preliminary determination under section 1673b(e)(1) of this title was negative, shall modify any suspension of liquidation and security requirement previously ordered under section 1673b(d) of this title to apply to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation was first ordered; or

    * For purposes of this subsection and section 1673b(d) of this title, the estimated all-others rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average of the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis margins, and any margins determined entirely under section 1677e of this title.

  * #### (B) Exception
    * If the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis margins, or are determined entirely under section 1677e of this title, the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the estimated weighted average dumping margins determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.

* #### (2) Special rule
  * If the Commission, in its final determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, finds threat of material injury, other than threat of material injury described in paragraph (1), or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States, then subject merchandise which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of notice of an affirmative determination of the Commission under section 1673d(b) of this title shall be subject to the assessment of antidumping duties under section 1673 of this title, and the administering authority shall release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit made, to secure the payment of antidumping duties with respect to entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.
