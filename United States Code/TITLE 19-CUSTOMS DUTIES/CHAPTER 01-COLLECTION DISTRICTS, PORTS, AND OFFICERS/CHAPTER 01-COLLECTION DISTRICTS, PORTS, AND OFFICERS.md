To the extent that funds in the Customs User Fee Account are insufficient to pay the costs of such customs revenue functions, customs duties in an amount equal to the amount of such insufficiency shall be available, to the extent provided for in appropriations Acts, to pay the costs of such customs revenue functions in the amount of such insufficiency, and shall be available for no other purpose. The provisions of the first and second sentences of this paragraph specifying the purposes for which amounts in the Customs User Fee Account may be made available shall not be superseded except by a provision of law which specifically modifies or supersedes such provisions. So long as there is a surplus of funds in the Customs User Fee Account, the Secretary of the Treasury may not reduce personnel staffing levels for providing commercial clearance and preclearance services.

* (3)(A) The Secretary of the Treasury, in accordance with section 1524 of this title and subject to subparagraph (B), shall directly reimburse, from the fees collected under subsection (a) (other than the fees under subsection (a)(9) and (10) and the excess fees determined by the Secretary under paragraph (4)), each appropriation for the amount paid out of that appropriation for the costs incurred by the Secretary—

    * (I) paying overtime compensation under section 267(a) of this title,

    * (II) paying premium pay under section 267(b) of this title, but the amount for which reimbursement may be made under this subclause may not, for any fiscal year, exceed the difference between the total cost of all the premium pay for such year calculated under section 267(b) of this title and the cost of the night and holiday premium pay that the Customs Service would have incurred for the same inspectional work on the day before August 10, 1993,

    * (III) paying agency contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to match deductions from the overtime compensation paid under subclause (I),

    * (IV) providing all preclearance services for which the recipients of such services are not required to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury, and

    * (V) paying foreign language proficiency awards under section 267a of this title,


  * (ii) to the extent funds remain available after making reimbursements under clause (i), in providing salaries for full-time and part-time inspectional personnel and equipment that enhance customs services for those persons or entities that are required to pay fees under paragraphs (1) through (8) of subsection (a) (distributed on a basis proportionate to the fees collected under paragraphs (1) through (8) of subsection (a)), and

  * (iii) to the extent funds remain available after making reimbursements under clause (ii), in providing salaries for up to 50 full-time equivalent inspectional positions to provide preclearance services.


* The transfer of funds required under subparagraph (C)(iii) has priority over reimbursements under this subparagraph to carry out subclauses (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i). Funds described in clause (ii) shall only be available to reimburse costs in excess of the highest amount appropriated for such costs during the period beginning with fiscal year 1990 and ending with the current fiscal year.

* (B) Reimbursement of appropriations under this paragraph—

  * (i) shall be subject to apportionment or similar administrative practices;

  * (ii) shall be made at least quarterly; and

  * (iii) to the extent necessary, may be made on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury and adjustments shall be made in subsequent reimbursements to the extent that the estimates were in excess of, or less than, the amounts required to be reimbursed.


* (C)(i) For fiscal year 1991 and subsequent fiscal years, the amount required to reimburse costs described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be projected from actual requirements, and only the excess of collections over such projected costs for such fiscal year shall be used as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii).

* (ii) The excess of collections over inspectional overtime and preclearance costs (under subparagraph (A)(i)) reimbursed for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 shall be available in fiscal year 1991 and subsequent fiscal years for the purposes described in subparagraph (A)(ii), except that $30,000,000 of such excess shall remain without fiscal year limitation in a contingency fund and, in any fiscal year in which receipts are insufficient to cover the costs described in subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), shall be used for—

  * (I) the costs of providing the services described in subparagraph (A)(i), and

  * (II) after the costs described in subclause (I) are paid, the costs of providing the personnel and equipment described in subparagraph (A)(ii) at the preceding fiscal year level.


* (iii) For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall calculate the difference between—

  * (I) the estimated cost for overtime compensation that would have been incurred during that fiscal year for inspectional services if sections 261 and 267 of this title, as in effect before the enactment of section 13811 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, had governed such costs, and

  * (II) the actual cost for overtime compensation, premium pay, and agency retirement contributions that is incurred during that fiscal year in regard to inspectional services under section 267 of this title, as amended by section 13811 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and under section 8331(3) of title 5, as amended by section 13812(a)(1) of such Act of 1993, plus the actual cost that is incurred during that fiscal year for foreign language proficiency awards under section 267a of this title,


* and shall transfer from the Customs User Fee Account to the General Fund of the Treasury an amount equal to the difference calculated under this clause, or $18,000,000, whichever amount is less. Transfers shall be made under this clause at least quarterly and on the basis of estimates to the same extent as are reimbursements under subparagraph (B)(iii).

* (D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to preclude the use of appropriated funds, from sources other than the fees collected under subsection (a), to pay the costs set forth in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A).

* (4)(A) There is created within the general fund of the Treasury a separate account that shall be known as the "Customs Commercial and Homeland Security Automation Account". In each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 there shall be deposited into the Account from fees collected under subsection (a)(9)(A), $350,000,000.

* (B) There is authorized to be appropriated from the Account in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 not less than $153,736,000 to complete the development and implementation, establishment, and implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment computer system for the processing of merchandise that is entered or released and for other purposes related to the functions of the Department of Homeland Security. Amounts appropriated pursuant to this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.

* (C) In adjusting the fee imposed by subsection (a)(9)(A) for fiscal year 2006, the Secretary of the Treasury shall reduce the amount estimated to be collected in fiscal year 2006 by the amount by which total fees deposited to the Account during fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 exceed total appropriations from that Account.

* (5) Of the amounts collected in fiscal year 1999 under paragraphs (9) and (10) of subsection (a), $50,000,000 shall be available to the Customs Service, subject to appropriations Acts, for automated commercial systems. Amounts made available under this paragraph shall remain available until expended.

* (2) Except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations, all administrative and enforcement provisions of customs laws and regulations, other than those laws and regulations relating to drawback, shall apply with respect to any fee prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, and with respect to persons liable therefor, as if such fee is a customs duty. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any penalty expressed in terms of a relationship to the amount of the duty shall be treated as not less than the amount which bears a similar relationship to the amount of the fee assessed. For purposes of determining the jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any agency of the United States, any fee prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as if such fee is a customs duty.
