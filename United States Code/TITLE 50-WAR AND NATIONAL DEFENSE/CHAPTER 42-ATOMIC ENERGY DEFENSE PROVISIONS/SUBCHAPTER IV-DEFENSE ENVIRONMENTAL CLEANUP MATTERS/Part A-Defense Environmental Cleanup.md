### PART A—DEFENSE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

### §2581. Defense Environmental Cleanup Account
#### (a) Establishment
* There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States for the Department of Energy an account to be known as the "Defense Environmental Cleanup Account" (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Account").

#### (b) Amounts in Account
* All sums appropriated to the Department of Energy for defense environmental cleanup at defense nuclear facilities shall be credited to the Account. Such appropriations shall be authorized annually by law. To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, amounts in the Account shall remain available until expended.

### §2582. Requirement to develop future use plans for defense environmental cleanup
#### (a) Authority to develop future use plans
* The Secretary of Energy may develop future use plans for any defense nuclear facility at which defense environmental cleanup activities are occurring.
