### SUBCHAPTER III–A—PUBLIC INTEREST DECLASSIFICATIONS

### §3355. Findings
* Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) It is in the national interest to establish an effective, coordinated, and cost-effective means by which records on specific subjects of extraordinary public interest that do not undermine the national security interests of the United States may be collected, retained, reviewed, and disseminated to Congress, policymakers in the executive branch, and the public.
