* (a) The days of leave provided by this subchapter are days on which an employee would otherwise work and receive pay and are exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays established by Federal statute, Executive order, or administrative order.

* (b) For the purpose of this subchapter an employee is deemed employed for a full biweekly pay period if he is employed during the days within that period, exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays established by Federal statute, Executive order, or administrative order, which fall within his basic administrative workweek.

### §6303. Annual leave; accrual

  * (3) one day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with 15 or more years of service.


* In determining years of service, an employee is entitled to credit for all service of a type that would be creditable under section 8332, regardless of whether or not the employee is covered by subchapter III of chapter 83, and for all service which is creditable by virtue of subsection (e). However, an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service as defined by section 3501 of this title is entitled to credit for active military service only if—

* The determination of years of service may be made on the basis of an affidavit of the employee. Leave provided by this subchapter accrues to an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods on the same basis as it would accrue if the employee were paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods.

* (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave under this subchapter only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him under subsection (a) of this section except for this subsection.

* (c) A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this section takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.

* (d) Leave granted under this subchapter is exclusive of time actually and necessarily occupied in going to or from a post of duty and time necessarily occupied awaiting transportation, in the case of an employee—

  * (1) to whom section 6304(b) of this title applies;

  * (2) whose post of duty is outside the United States; and

* This subsection does not apply to more than one period of leave in a prescribed tour of duty at a post outside the United States.

* (e)(1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which, for purposes of determining years of service under subsection (a), credit shall, in the case of a newly appointed employee, be given for any prior service of such employee that would not otherwise be creditable for such purposes, if—

  * (A) such service—

    * (i) was performed in a position the duties of which directly relate to the duties of the position to which such employee is so appointed; and

    * (ii) meets such other requirements as the Office may prescribe; and


  * (B) in the judgment of the head of the appointing agency, the application of this subsection is necessary in order to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal.


* (2) Service described in paragraph (1)—

  * (A) shall be creditable, for the purposes described in paragraph (1), as of the effective date of the employee's appointment; and

  * (B) shall not thereafter cease to be so creditable, unless the employee fails to complete a full year of continuous service with the agency.


* (3) An employee shall not be eligible for the application of paragraph (1) on the basis of any appointment if, within 90 days before the effective date of such appointment, such employee has held any position in the civil service.

* (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the rate of accrual of annual leave under subsection (a) shall be 1 day for each full biweekly pay period in the case of any employee who holds a position which is subject to—

  * (1) section 5376 or 5383; or

  * (2) a pay system equivalent to either of the foregoing, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management.

### §6304. Annual leave; accumulation
* (a) Except as provided by subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, annual leave provided by section 6303 of this title, which is not used by an employee, accumulates for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 30 days at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year.

* (b) Annual leave not used by an employee of the Government of the United States in one of the following classes of employees stationed outside the United States accumulates for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 45 days at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year:

  * (1) Individuals directly recruited or transferred by the Government of the United States from the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for employment outside the area of recruitment or from which transferred.

    * (A)(i) who were originally recruited from the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but outside the area of employment;

  * (3) Individuals who are not normally residents of the area concerned and who are discharged from service in the armed forces to accept employment with an agency of the Government of the United States.


* (c) Annual leave in excess of the amount allowable—

  * (1) under subsection (a) or (b) of this section which was accumulated under earlier statute; or

  * (2) under subsection (a) of this section which was accumulated under subsection (b) of this section by an employee who becomes subject to subsection (a) of this section;


* remains to the credit of the employee until used. The excess annual leave is reduced at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year, by the amount of annual leave the employee used during the preceding year in excess of the amount which accrued during that year, until the employee's accumulated leave does not exceed the amount allowed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.

* (d)(1) Annual leave which is lost by operation of this section because of—

  * (A) administrative error when the error causes a loss of annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960;

  * (B) exigencies of the public business when the annual leave was scheduled in advance; or

  * (C) sickness of the employee when the annual leave was scheduled in advance;


* shall be restored to the employee.

* (2) Annual leave restored under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or under clause (2) of section 5562(a) of this title, which is in excess of the maximum leave accumulation permitted by law shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee within the time limits prescribed by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management. Leave credited under this paragraph but unused and still available to the employee under the regulations prescribed by the Office shall be included in the lump-sum payment under section 5551 or 5552(1) of this title but may not be retained to the credit of the employee under section 5552(2) of this title.

* (3)(A) For the purpose of this subsection, the closure of, and any realignment with respect to, an installation of the Department of Defense pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101–510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) during any period, the closure of an installation of the Department of Defense in the Republic of Panama in accordance with the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, and the closure of any other installation of the Department of Defense, during the period beginning on October 1, 1992, and ending on December 31, 1997, shall be deemed to create an exigency of the public business and any leave that is lost by an employee of such installation by operation of this section (regardless of whether such leave was scheduled) shall be restored to the employee and shall be credited and available in accordance with paragraph (2).

* (B) For the purpose of subparagraph (A), the term "realignment" means a base realignment (as defined in subsection (e)(3) of section 2687 of title 10) that meets the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of such section.

* (4)(A) For the purpose of this subsection, service of a Department of Defense emergency essential employee in a combat zone is an exigency of the public business for that employee. Any leave that, by reason of such service, is lost by the employee by operation of this section (regardless of whether such leave was scheduled) shall be restored to the employee and shall be credited and available in accordance with paragraph (2).

* (e) Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost by operation of this section because of administrative error and which is not credited under subsection (d)(2) of this section because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date of discovery of the error. Payment shall be made by the agency of employment when the lump-sum payment provisions of section 5551 of this title last became applicable to the employee at the rate of basic pay in effect on the date the lump-sum provisions became applicable.

Leave so granted—

  * (1) is for use in the United States, or if the employee's place of residence is outside the area of employment, in its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;

  * (2) accumulates for future use without regard to the limitation in section 6304(b) of this title; and

  * (3) may not be made the basis for terminal leave except under such special or emergency circumstances as may be prescribed under the regulations of the Office.

### §6306. Annual leave; refund of lump-sum payment; recredit of annual leave

* (b) An amount refunded under subsection (a) of this section shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the employing agency. When an individual is reemployed under the same leave system, an amount of leave equal to the leave represented by the refund shall be recredited to him in the employing agency. When an individual is reemployed under a different leave system, an amount of leave equal to the leave represented by the refund shall be recredited to him in the employing agency on an adjusted basis under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management. When an individual is reemployed in a position excepted from this subchapter by section 6301(2)(x)–(xiii) of this title, an amount of leave equal to the leave represented by the refund is deemed, on separation from the service, death, or transfer to another position in the service, to have remained to his credit.

* (2) Subject to paragraph (3) and in addition to any other allowable purpose, sick leave may be used by an employee—

  * (i) 40 hours in any year, plus

  * (ii) up to an additional 64 hours in any year, but only to the extent the use of such additional hours does not cause the amount of sick leave to the employee's credit to fall below 80 hours.

However, when a former member receiving a retirement annuity under sections 521–535 of title 4, District of Columbia Code, is reemployed in a position to which this subchapter applies, his sick leave balance may not be recredited to his account on the later reemployment.

* (b) The annual leave, sick leave, and home leave to the credit of a nonappropriated fund employee of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard described in section 2105(c) who moves without a break in service of more than 3 days to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, that is subject to this subchapter shall be transferred to the employee's credit.
