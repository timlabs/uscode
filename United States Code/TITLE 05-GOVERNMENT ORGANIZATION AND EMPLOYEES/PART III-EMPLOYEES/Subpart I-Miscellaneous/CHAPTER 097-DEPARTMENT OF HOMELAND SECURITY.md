  * (1) IN GENERAL.—In order to ensure that the authority of this section is exercised in collaboration with, and in a manner that ensures the participation of employee representatives in the planning, development, and implementation of any human resources management system or adjustments to such system under this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall provide for the following:

    * (A) NOTICE OF PROPOSAL.—The Secretary and the Director shall, with respect to any proposed system or adjustment—

      * (i) provide to each employee representative representing any employees who might be affected, a written description of the proposed system or adjustment (including the reasons why it is considered necessary);

      * (ii) give each representative 30 calendar days (unless extraordinary circumstances require earlier action) to review and make recommendations with respect to the proposal; and

      * (iii) give any recommendations received from any such representatives under clause (ii) full and fair consideration in deciding whether or how to proceed with the proposal.


    * (B) PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION, AND MEDIATION.—Following receipt of recommendations, if any, from employee representatives with respect to a proposal described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Director shall accept such modifications to the proposal in response to the recommendations as they determine advisable and shall, with respect to any parts of the proposal as to which they have not accepted the recommendations—

      * (i) notify Congress of those parts of the proposal, together with the recommendations of employee representatives;

      * (ii) meet and confer for not less than 30 calendar days with any representatives who have made recommendations, in order to attempt to reach agreement on whether or how to proceed with those parts of the proposal; and

      * (iii) at the Secretary's option, or if requested by a majority of the employee representatives who have made recommendations, use the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service during such meet and confer period to facilitate the process of attempting to reach agreement.


    * (C) IMPLEMENTATION.—

      * (i) Any part of the proposal as to which the representatives do not make a recommendation, or as to which their recommendations are accepted by the Secretary and the Director, may be implemented immediately.

      * (ii) With respect to any parts of the proposal as to which recommendations have been made but not accepted by the Secretary and the Director, at any time after 30 calendar days have elapsed since the initiation of the congressional notification, consultation, and mediation procedures set forth in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary determines, in the Secretary's sole and unreviewable discretion, that further consultation and mediation is unlikely to produce agreement, the Secretary may implement any or all of such parts, including any modifications made in response to the recommendations as the Secretary determines advisable.

      * (iii) The Secretary shall promptly notify Congress of the implementation of any part of the proposal and shall furnish with such notice an explanation of the proposal, any changes made to the proposal as a result of recommendations from employee representatives, and of the reasons why implementation is appropriate under this subparagraph.


    * (D) CONTINUING COLLABORATION.—If a proposal described in subparagraph (A) is implemented, the Secretary and the Director shall—

      * (i) develop a method for each employee representative to participate in any further planning or development which might become necessary; and

      * (ii) give each employee representative adequate access to information to make that participation productive.


  * (2) PROCEDURES.—Any procedures necessary to carry out this subsection shall be established by the Secretary and the Director jointly as internal rules of departmental procedure which shall not be subject to review. Such procedures shall include measures to ensure—

    * (A) in the case of employees within a unit with respect to which a labor organization is accorded exclusive recognition, representation by individuals designated or from among individuals nominated by such organization;

    * (B) in the case of any employees who are not within such a unit, representation by any appropriate organization which represents a substantial percentage of those employees or, if none, in such other manner as may be appropriate, consistent with the purposes of the subsection;

    * (C) the fair and expeditious handling of the consultation and mediation process described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), including procedures by which, if the number of employee representatives providing recommendations exceeds 5, such representatives select a committee or other unified representative with which the Secretary and Director may meet and confer; and

    * (D) the selection of representatives in a manner consistent with the relative number of employees represented by the organizations or other representatives involved.


* (f) PROVISIONS RELATING TO APPELLATE PROCEDURES.—

  * (1) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—

    * (A) employees of the Department are entitled to fair treatment in any appeals that they bring in decisions relating to their employment; and

    * (B) in prescribing regulations for any such appeals procedures, the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management—

      * (i) should ensure that employees of the Department are afforded the protections of due process; and

      * (ii) toward that end, should be required to consult with the Merit Systems Protection Board before issuing any such regulations.

    * (C) shall modify procedures under chapter 77 only insofar as such modifications are designed to further the fair, efficient, and expeditious resolution of matters involving the employees of the Department.


* (g) PROVISIONS RELATING TO LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS.—Nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring authority on the Secretary of Homeland Security to modify any of the provisions of section 842 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

* (h) SUNSET PROVISION.—Effective 5 years after the conclusion of the transition period defined under section 1501 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, all authority to issue regulations under this section (including regulations which would modify, supersede, or terminate any regulations previously issued under this section) shall cease to be available.
