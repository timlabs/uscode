### §8102a. Death gratuity for injuries incurred in connection with employee's service with an Armed Force

However, only one father and one mother, or their counterparts in loco parentis, may be recognized in any case, and preference shall be given to those who exercised a parental relationship on the date, or most nearly before the date, on which the decedent became an employee.

  * (4) A person covered by this section may designate another person to receive an amount payable under this section. The designation shall indicate the percentage of the amount, to be specified only in 10 percent increments, that the designated person may receive. The balance of the amount of the death gratuity shall be paid to or for the living survivors of the person concerned in accordance with subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).

### §8103. Medical services and initial medical and other benefits
* (a) The United States shall furnish to an employee who is injured while in the performance of duty, the services, appliances, and supplies prescribed or recommended by a qualified physician, which the Secretary of Labor considers likely to cure, give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of the monthly compensation. These services, appliances, and supplies shall be furnished—

  * (1) whether or not disability has arisen;

  * (2) notwithstanding that the employee has accepted or is entitled to receive benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title or another retirement system for employees of the Government; and

* The employee may initially select a physician to provide medical services, appliances, and supplies, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary, and may be furnished necessary and reasonable transportation and expenses incident to the securing of such services, appliances, and supplies. These expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, shall be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.

* (b) The Secretary, under such limitations or conditions as he considers necessary, may authorize the employing agencies to provide for the initial furnishing of medical and other benefits under this section. The Secretary may certify vouchers for these expenses out of the Employees' Compensation Fund when the immediate superior of the employee certifies that the expense was incurred in respect to an injury which was accepted by the employing agency as probably compensable under this subchapter. The Secretary shall prescribe the form and content of the certificate.

### §8104. Vocational rehabilitation
* (a) The Secretary of Labor may direct a permanently disabled individual whose disability is compensable under this subchapter to undergo vocational rehabilitation. The Secretary shall provide for furnishing the vocational rehabilitation services. In providing for these services, the Secretary, insofar as practicable, shall use the services or facilities of State agencies and corresponding agencies which cooperate with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in carrying out the purposes of chapter 4 of title 29, except to the extent that the Secretary of Labor provides for furnishing these services under section 8103 of this title. The cost of providing these services to individuals undergoing vocational rehabilitation under this section shall be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund. However, in reimbursing a State or corresponding agency under an arrangement pursuant to this section the cost to the agency reimbursable in full under section 32(b)(1) of title 29 is excluded.

* (b) Notwithstanding section 8106, individuals directed to undergo vocational rehabilitation by the Secretary shall, while undergoing such rehabilitation, receive compensation at the rate provided in sections 8105 and 8110 of this title, less the amount of any earnings received from remunerative employment, other than employment undertaken pursuant to such rehabilitation.

### §8105. Total disability
* (a) If the disability is total, the United States shall pay the employee during the disability monthly monetary compensation equal to 662/3 percent of his monthly pay, which is known as his basic compensation for total disability.

* (b) The loss of use of both hands, both arms, both feet, or both legs, or the loss of sight of both eyes, is prima facie permanent total disability.

### §8106. Partial disability
* (a) If the disability is partial, the United States shall pay the employee during the disability monthly monetary compensation equal to 662/3 percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity after the beginning of the partial disability, which is known as his basic compensation for partial disability.

* (b) The Secretary of Labor may require a partially disabled employee to report his earnings from employment or self-employment, by affidavit or otherwise, in the manner and at the times the Secretary specifies. The employee shall include in the affidavit or report the value of housing, board, lodging, and other advantages which are part of his earnings in employment or self-employment and which can be estimated in money. An employee who—

  * (1) fails to make an affidavit or report when required; or

  * (2) knowingly omits or understates any part of his earnings;


* forfeits his right to compensation with respect to any period for which the affidavit or report was required. Compensation forfeited under this subsection, if already paid, shall be recovered by a deduction from the compensation payable to the employee or otherwise recovered under section 8129 of this title, unless recovery is waived under that section.

* (c) A partially disabled employee who—

  * (1) refuses to seek suitable work; or

  * (2) refuses or neglects to work after suitable work is offered to, procured by, or secured for him;


* is not entitled to compensation.

### §8107. Compensation schedule
* (a) If there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, the employee is entitled to basic compensation for the disability, as provided by the schedule in subsection (c) of this section, at the rate of 662/3 percent of his monthly pay. The basic compensation is—

  * (1) payable regardless of whether the cause of the disability originates in a part of the body other than that member;

  * (2) payable regardless of whether the disability also involves another impairment of the body; and

  * (3) in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability.


* (b) With respect to any period after payments under subsection (a) of this section have ended, an employee is entitled to compensation as provided by—

  * (1) section 8105 of this title if the disability is total; or

  * (2) section 8106 of this title if the disability is partial.


* (c) The compensation schedule is as follows:

  * (1) Arm lost, 312 weeks' compensation.

    * (A) complete loss of hearing of one ear, 52 weeks' compensation; or

    * (B) complete loss of hearing of both ears, 200 weeks' compensation.


  * (14) Compensation for loss of binocular vision or for loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye is the same as for loss of the eye.

  * (15) Compensation for loss of more than one phalanx of a digit is the same as for loss of the entire digit. Compensation for loss of the first phalanx is one-half of the compensation for loss of the entire digit.

  * (16) If, in the case of an arm or a leg, the member is amputated above the wrist or ankle, compensation is the same as for loss of the arm or leg, respectively.

  * (17) Compensation for loss of use of two or more digits, or one or more phalanges of each of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, is proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned thereby.

  * (18) Compensation for permanent total loss of use of a member is the same as for loss of the member.

  * (19) Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss of use of the member. The degree of loss of vision or hearing under this schedule is determined without regard to correction.

  * (20) In case of loss of use of more than one member or parts of more than one member as enumerated by this schedule, the compensation is for loss of use of each member or part thereof, and the awards run consecutively. However, when the injury affects only two or more digits of the same hand or foot, paragraph (17) of this subsection applies, and when partial bilateral loss of hearing is involved, compensation is computed on the loss as affecting both ears.

  * (21) For serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck of a character likely to handicap an individual in securing or maintaining employment, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed $3,500 shall be awarded in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.

### §8108. Reduction of compensation for subsequent injury to same member
* The period of compensation payable under the schedule in section 8107(c) of this title is reduced by the period of compensation paid or payable under the schedule for an earlier injury if—

  * (1) compensation in both cases is for disability of the same member or function or different parts of the same member or function or for disfigurement; and

  * (2) the Secretary of Labor finds that compensation payable for the later disability in whole or in part would duplicate the compensation payable for the preexisting disability.


* In such a case, compensation for disability continuing after the scheduled period starts on expiration of that period as reduced under this section.

### §8109. Beneficiaries of awards unpaid at death; order of precedence
* (a) If an individual—

  * (1) has sustained disability compensable under section 8107(a) of this title;

  * (2) has filed a valid claim in his lifetime; and

  * (3) dies from a cause other than the injury before the end of the period specified by the schedule;


* the compensation specified by the schedule that is unpaid at his death, whether or not accrued or due at his death, shall be paid—

  * (A) under an award made before or after the death;

  * (B) for the period specified by the schedule;

  * (C) to and for the benefit of the persons then in being within the classes and proportions and on the conditions specified by this section; and

  * (D) in the following order of precedence:

    * (i) If there is no child, to the widow or widower.

    * (ii) If there are both a widow or widower and a child or children, one-half to the widow or widower and one-half to the child or children.

    * (iii) If there is no widow or widower, to the child or children.

    * (iv) If there is no survivor in the above classes, to the parent or parents wholly or partly dependent for support on the decedent, or to other wholly dependent relatives listed by section 8133(a)(5) of this title, or to both in proportions provided by regulation.

    * (v) If there is no survivor in the above classes and no burial allowance is payable under section 8134 of this title, an amount not exceeding that which would be expendable under section 8134 of this title if applicable shall be paid to reimburse a person equitably entitled thereto to the extent and in the proportion that he has paid the burial expenses, but a compensated insurer or other person obligated by law or contract to pay the burial expenses or a State or political subdivision or entity is deemed not equitably entitled.


* (b) Payments under subsection (a) of this section, except for an amount payable for a period preceding the death of the individual, are at the basic rate of compensation for permanent disability specified by section 8107(a) of this title even if at the time of death the individual was entitled to the augmented rate specified by section 8110 of this title.

* (c) A surviving beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), does not have a vested right to payment and must be alive to receive payment.

* (d) A beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), ceases to be entitled to payment on the happening of an event which would terminate his right to compensation for death under section 8133 of this title. When that entitlement ceases, compensation remaining unpaid under subsection (a) of this section is payable to the surviving beneficiary in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

### §8110. Augmented compensation for dependents
* (a) For the purpose of this section, "dependent" means—

  * (1) a wife, if—

    * (A) she is a member of the same household as the employee;

    * (B) she is receiving regular contributions from the employee for her support; or

    * (C) the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to her support;


  * (2) a husband, if—

    * (A) he is a member of the same household as the employee; or

    * (B) he is receiving regular contributions from the employee for his support; or

    * (C) the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to his support;


  * (3) an unmarried child, while living with the employee or receiving regular contributions from the employee toward his support, and who is—

    * (B) over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support because of physical or mental disability; and


  * (4) a parent, while wholly dependent on and supported by the employee.


* Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection, compensation payable for a child that would otherwise end because the child has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by section 8101 of this title at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries.

* (b) A disabled employee with one or more dependents is entitled to have his basic compensation for disability augmented—

  * (1) at the rate of 81/3 percent of his monthly pay if that compensation is payable under section 8105 or 8107(a) of this title; and

  * (2) at the rate of 81/3 percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity if that compensation is payable under section 8106(a) of this title.

### §8111. Additional compensation for services of attendants or vocational rehabilitation
* (a) The Secretary of Labor may pay an employee who has been awarded compensation an additional sum of not more than $1,500 a month, as the Secretary considers necessary, when the Secretary finds that the service of an attendant is necessary constantly because the employee is totally blind, or has lost the use of both hands or both feet, or is paralyzed and unable to walk, or because of other disability resulting from the injury making him so helpless as to require constant attendance.

* (b) The Secretary may pay an individual undergoing vocational rehabilitation under section 8104 of this title additional compensation necessary for his maintenance, but not to exceed $200 a month.

### §8112. Maximum and minimum monthly payments
* (a) Except as provided by section 8138 of this title, the monthly rate of compensation for disability, including augmented compensation under section 8110 of this title but not including additional compensation under section 8111 of this title, may not be more than 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS–15, and in case of total disability may not be less than 75 percent of the monthly pay of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–2 or the amount of the monthly pay of the employee, whichever is less.

* (b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to any employee whose disability is a result of an assault which occurs during an assassination or attempted assassination of a Federal official described under section 351(a) or 1751(a) of title 18, and was sustained in the performance of duty.

### §8113. Increase or decrease of basic compensation
* (a) If an individual—

  * (1) was a minor or employed in a learner's capacity at the time of injury; and

  * (2) was not physically or mentally handicapped before the injury;


* the Secretary of Labor, on review under section 8128 of this title after the time the wage-earning capacity of the individual would probably have increased but for the injury, shall recompute prospectively the monetary compensation payable for disability on the basis of an assumed monthly pay corresponding to the probable increased wage-earning capacity.

* (b) If an individual without good cause fails to apply for and undergo vocational rehabilitation when so directed under section 8104 of this title, the Secretary, on review under section 8128 of this title and after finding that in the absence of the failure the wage-earning capacity of the individual would probably have substantially increased, may reduce prospectively the monetary compensation of the individual in accordance with what would probably have been his wage-earning capacity in the absence of the failure, until the individual in good faith complies with the direction of the Secretary.

### §8114. Computation of pay
* (a) For the purpose of this section—

  * (1) "overtime pay" means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of worktime, as observed by the employing establishment; and

  * (2) "year" means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.


* (b) In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.

* (c) The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earnings. However, for so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury in which event he may be paid compensation for the days he would have worked but for the injury.

* (d) Average annual earnings are determined as follows:

  * (1) If the employee worked in the employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay—

    * (A) was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or

    * (B) was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his daily wage for the particular employment, or the average thereof if the daily wage has fluctuated, by 300 if he was employed on the basis of a 6-day workweek, 280 if employed on the basis of a 5½-day week, and 260 if employed on the basis of a 5-day week.


  * (2) If the employee did not work in employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment by the United States in the same or neighboring place, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection.

  * (3) If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in Federal employment, and of other employees of the United States in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee, or other relevant factors. However, the average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his injury.

  * (4) If the employee served without pay or at nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply as far as practicable, but the average annual earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–15. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.


* (e) The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money, and premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) of this title are included as part of the pay, but account is not taken of—

  * (1) overtime pay;

  * (2) additional pay or allowance authorized outside the United States because of differential in cost of living or other special circumstances; or

  * (3) bonus or premium pay for extraordinary service including bonus or pay for particularly hazardous service in time of war.

### §8115. Determination of wage-earning capacity
* (a) In determining compensation for partial disability, except permanent partial disability compensable under sections 8107–8109 of this title, the wage-earning capacity of an employee is determined by his actual earnings if his actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings of the employee do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity or if the employee has no actual earnings, his wage-earning capacity as appears reasonable under the circumstances is determined with due regard to—

  * (1) the nature of his injury;

  * (2) the degree of physical impairment;

  * (3) his usual employment;

  * (4) his age;

  * (5) his qualifications for other employment;

  * (6) the availability of suitable employment; and

  * (7) other factors or circumstances which may affect his wage-earning capacity in his disabled condition.


* (b) Section 8114(d) of this title is applicable in determining the wage-earning capacity of an employee after the beginning of partial disability.

### §8116. Limitations on right to receive compensation
* (a) While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except—

  * (1) in return for service actually performed;

  * (2) pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;

  * (3) other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and

  * (4) retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.


* However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.

* (b) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for good cause by the Secretary of Labor. The election when made is irrevocable, except as otherwise provided by statute.

* (c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.

* (d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an individual receiving benefits for disability or death under this subchapter who is also receiving benefits under subchapter III of chapter 84 of this title or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be entitled to all such benefits, except that—

  * (1) benefits received under section 223 of the Social Security Act (on account of disability) shall be subject to reduction on account of benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to the provisions of section 224 of the Social Security Act; and

  * (2) in the case of benefits received on account of age or death under title II of the Social Security Act, compensation payable under this subchapter based on the Federal service of an employee shall be reduced by the amount of any such social security benefits payable that are attributable to Federal service of that employee covered by chapter 84 of this title. However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 84 of this title, or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act by virtue of service covered by chapter 84 of this title, does not affect the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.

### §8117. Time of accrual of right
* (a) An employee other than a Postal Service employee is not entitled to compensation for the first 3 days of temporary disability, except—

  * (1) when the disability exceeds 14 days;

  * (2) when the disability is followed by permanent disability; or

  * (3) as provided by sections 8103 and 8104 of this title.


* (b) A Postal Service employee is not entitled to compensation or continuation of pay for the first 3 days of temporary disability, except as provided under paragraph (3) of subsection (a). A Postal Service employee may use annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay during that 3-day period, except that if the disability exceeds 14 days or is followed by permanent disability, the employee may have their sick leave or annual leave reinstated or receive pay for the time spent on leave without pay under this section.

### §8118. Continuation of pay; election to use annual or sick leave
* (a) The United States shall authorize the continuation of pay of an employee, as defined in section 8101(1) of this title (other than those referred to in clause (B) or (E)), who has filed a claim for a period of wage loss due to a traumatic injury with his immediate superior on a form approved by the Secretary of Labor within the time specified in section 8122(a)(2) of this title.

* (b) Continuation of pay under this subchapter shall be furnished—

  * (1) without a break in time, except as provided under section 8117(b), unless controverted under regulations of the Secretary;

  * (2) for a period not to exceed 45 days; and

  * (3) under accounting procedures and such other regulations as the Secretary may require.


* (c) An employee may use annual or sick leave to his credit at the time the disability begins, but his compensation for disability does not begin, and the time periods specified by section 8117 of this title do not begin to run, until termination of pay as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) or the use of annual or sick leave ends.

* (d) If a claim under subsection (a) is denied by the Secretary, payments under this section shall, at the option of the employee, be charged to sick or annual leave or shall be deemed overpayments of pay within the meaning of section 5584 of title 5, United States Code.

* (e) Payments under this section shall not be considered as compensation as defined by section 8101(12) of this title.

### §8119. Notice of injury or death
* An employee injured in the performance of his duty, or someone on his behalf, shall give notice thereof. Notice of a death believed to be related to the employment shall be given by an eligible beneficiary specified in section 8133 of this title, or someone on his behalf. A notice of injury or death shall—

  * (a) be given within 30 days after the injury or death;

  * (b) be given to the immediate superior of the employee by personal delivery or by depositing it in the mail properly stamped and addressed;

  * (c) be in writing;

  * (d) state the name and address of the employee;

  * (e) state the year, month, day, and hour when and the particular locality where the injury or death occurred;

  * (f) state the cause and nature of the injury, or, in the case of death, the employment factors believed to be the cause; and

  * (g) be signed by and contain the address of the individual giving the notice.

### §8120. Report of injury
* Immediately after an injury to an employee which results in his death or probable disability, his immediate superior shall report to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary may—

  * (1) prescribe the information that the report shall contain;

  * (2) require the immediate superior to make supplemental reports; and

  * (3) obtain such additional reports and information from employees as are agreed on by the Secretary and the head of the employing agency.

### §8121. Claim
* Compensation under this subchapter may be allowed only if an individual or someone on his behalf makes claim therefor. The claim shall—

  * (1) be made in writing within the time specified by section 8122 of this title;

  * (2) be delivered to the office of the Secretary of Labor or to an individual whom the Secretary may designate by regulation, or deposited in the mail properly stamped and addressed to the Secretary or his designee;

  * (3) be on a form approved by the Secretary;

  * (4) contain all information required by the Secretary;

  * (5) be sworn to by the individual entitled to compensation or someone on his behalf; and

  * (6) except in case of death, be accompanied by a certificate of the physician of the employee stating the nature of the injury and the nature and probable extent of the disability.


* The Secretary may waive paragraphs (3)–(6) of this section for reasonable cause shown.

### §8122. Time for making claim
* (a) An original claim for compensation for disability or death must be filed within 3 years after the injury or death. Compensation for disability or death, including medical care in disability cases, may not be allowed if claim is not filed within that time unless—

  * (1) the immediate superior had actual knowledge of the injury or death within 30 days. The knowledge must be such to put the immediate superior reasonably on notice of an on-the-job injury or death; or

  * (2) written notice of injury or death as specified in section 8119 of this title was given within 30 days.


* (b) In a case of latent disability, the time for filing claim does not begin to run until the employee has a compensable disability and is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, of the causal relationship of the compensable disability to his employment. In such a case, the time for giving notice of injury begins to run when the employee is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, that his condition is causally related to his employment, whether or not there is a compensable disability.

* (c) The timely filing of a disability claim because of injury will satisfy the time requirements for a death claim based on the same injury.

* (d) The time limitations in subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not—

  * (1) begin to run against a minor until he reaches 21 years of age or has had a legal representative appointed; or

  * (2) run against an incompetent individual while he is incompetent and has no duly appointed legal representative; or

  * (3) run against any individual whose failure to comply is excused by the Secretary on the ground that such notice could not be given because of exceptional circumstances.

### §8123. Physical examinations
* (a) An employee shall submit to examination by a medical officer of the United States, or by a physician designated or approved by the Secretary of Labor, after the injury and as frequently and at the times and places as may be reasonably required. The employee may have a physician designated and paid by him present to participate in the examination. If there is disagreement between the physician making the examination for the United States and the physician of the employee, the Secretary shall appoint a third physician who shall make an examination.

* (b) An employee is entitled to be paid expenses incident to an examination required by the Secretary which in the opinion of the Secretary are necessary and reasonable, including transportation and loss of wages incurred in order to be examined. The expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.

* (c) The Secretary shall fix the fees for examinations held under this section by physicians not employed by or under contract to the United States to furnish medical services to employees. The fees, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.

* (d) If an employee refuses to submit to or obstructs an examination, his right to compensation under this subchapter is suspended until the refusal or obstruction stops. Compensation is not payable while a refusal or obstruction continues, and the period of the refusal or obstruction is deducted from the period for which compensation is payable to the employee.

### §8124. Findings and award; hearings
* (a) The Secretary of Labor shall determine and make a finding of facts and make an award for or against payment of compensation under this subchapter after—

  * (1) considering the claim presented by the beneficiary and the report furnished by the immediate superior; and

  * (2) completing such investigation as he considers necessary.


* (b)(1) Before review under section 8128(a) of this title, a claimant for compensation not satisfied with a decision of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section is entitled, on request made within 30 days after the date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on his claim before a representative of the Secretary. At the hearing, the claimant is entitled to present evidence in further support of his claim. Within 30 days after the hearing ends, the Secretary shall notify the claimant in writing of his further decision and any modifications of the award he may make and of the basis of his decision.

* (2) In conducting the hearing, the representative of the Secretary is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, or by section 554 of this title except as provided by this subchapter, but may conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For this purpose, he shall receive such relevant evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as he determines necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.

### §8125. Misbehavior at proceedings
* If an individual—

  * (1) disobeys or resists a lawful order or process in proceedings under this subchapter before the Secretary of Labor or his representative; or

  * (2) misbehaves during a hearing or so near the place of hearing as to obstruct it;


* the Secretary or his representative shall certify the facts to the district court having jurisdiction in the place where he is sitting. The court, in a summary manner, shall hear the evidence as to the acts complained of and if the evidence warrants, punish the individual in the same manner and to the same extent as for a contempt committed before the court, or commit the individual on the same conditions as if the forbidden act had occurred with reference to the process of or in the presence of the court.

### §8126. Subpenas; oaths; examination of witnesses
* The Secretary of Labor, on any matter within his jurisdiction under this subchapter, may—

  * (1) issue subpenas for and compel the attendance of witnesses within a radius of 100 miles;

  * (2) administer oaths;

  * (3) examine witnesses; and

  * (4) require the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence.

### §8127. Representation; attorneys' fees
* (a) A claimant may authorize an individual to represent him in any proceeding under this subchapter before the Secretary of Labor.

* (b) A claim for legal or other services furnished in respect to a case, claim, or award for compensation under this subchapter is valid only if approved by the Secretary.

### §8128. Review of award
* (a) The Secretary of Labor may review an award for or against payment of compensation at any time on his own motion or on application. The Secretary, in accordance with the facts found on review, may—

  * (1) end, decrease, or increase the compensation previously awarded; or

  * (2) award compensation previously refused or discontinued.


* (b) The action of the Secretary or his designee in allowing or denying a payment under this subchapter is—

  * (1) final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact; and

  * (2) not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.


* Credit shall be allowed in the accounts of a certifying or disbursing official for payments in accordance with that action.

### §8129. Recovery of overpayments
* (a) When an overpayment has been made to an individual under this subchapter because of an error of fact or law, adjustment shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor by decreasing later payments to which the individual is entitled. If the individual dies before the adjustment is completed, adjustment shall be made by decreasing later benefits payable under this subchapter with respect to the individual's death.

* (b) Adjustment or recovery by the United States may not be made when incorrect payment has been made to an individual who is without fault and when adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.

* (c) A certifying or disbursing official is not liable for an amount certified or paid by him when—

  * (1) adjustment or recovery of the amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section; or

  * (2) adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed before the death of all individuals against whose benefits deductions are authorized.

### §8130. Assignment of claim
* An assignment of a claim for compensation under this subchapter is void. Compensation and claims for compensation are exempt from claims of creditors.

### §8131. Subrogation of the United States
* (a) If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability on a person other than the United States to pay damages, the Secretary of Labor may require the beneficiary to—

  * (1) assign to the United States any right of action he may have to enforce the liability or any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of that liability; or

  * (2) prosecute the action in his own name.


* An employee required to appear as a party or witness in the prosecution of such an action is in an active duty status while so engaged.

* (b) A beneficiary who refuses to assign or prosecute an action in his own name when required by the Secretary is not entitled to compensation under this subchapter.

* (c) The Secretary may prosecute or compromise a cause of action assigned to the United States. When the Secretary realizes on the cause of action, he shall deduct therefrom and place to the credit of the Employees' Compensation Fund the amount of compensation already paid to the beneficiary and the expense of realization or collection. Any surplus shall be paid to the beneficiary and credited on future payments of compensation payable for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to not less than one-fifth of the net amount of a settlement or recovery remaining after the expenses thereof have been deducted.

* (d) If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in the Panama Canal Company to pay damages under the law of a State, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country, compensation is not payable until the individual entitled to compensation—

  * (1) releases to the Panama Canal Company any right of action he may have to enforce the liability of the Panama Canal Company; or

  * (2) assigns to the United States any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of the liability of the Panama Canal Company.

### §8132. Adjustment after recovery from a third person
* If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages, and a beneficiary entitled to compensation from the United States for that injury or death receives money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement by him or in his behalf, the beneficiary, after deducting therefrom the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney's fee, shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States and credit any surplus on future payments of compensation payable to him for the same injury. No court, insurer, attorney, or other person shall pay or distribute to the beneficiary or his designee the proceeds of such suit or settlement without first satisfying or assuring satisfaction of the interest of the United States. The amount refunded to the United States shall be credited to the Employees' Compensation Fund. If compensation has not been paid to the beneficiary, he shall credit the money or property on compensation payable to him by the United States for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to retain, as a minimum, at least one-fifth of the net amount of the money or other property remaining after the expenses of a suit or settlement have been deducted; and in addition to this minimum and at the time of distribution, an amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney's fee proportionate to the refund to the United States.

### §8133. Compensation in case of death
* (a) If death results from an injury sustained in the performance of duty, the United States shall pay a monthly compensation equal to a percentage of the monthly pay of the deceased employee in accordance with the following schedule:

  * (1) To the widow or widower, if there is no child, 50 percent.

  * (2) To the widow or widower, if there is a child, 45 percent and in addition 15 percent for each child not to exceed a total of 75 percent for the widow or widower and children.

  * (3) To the children, if there is no widow or widower, 40 percent for one child and 15 percent additional for each additional child not to exceed a total of 75 percent, divided among the children share and share alike.

  * (4) To the parents, if there is no widow, widower, or child, as follows—

    * (A) 25 percent if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;

    * (B) 20 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; or

    * (C) a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor if one or both were partly dependent.


* If there is a widow, widower, or child, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.

  * (5) To the brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren, if there is no widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, as follows—

    * (A) 20 percent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death;

    * (B) 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike; or

    * (C) 10 percent if no one is wholly dependent but one or more is partly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike.


* If there is a widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, children, and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.


* (b) The compensation payable under subsection (a) of this section is paid from the time of death until—

  * (1) a widow, or widower dies or remarries before reaching age 55;

  * (2) a child, a brother, a sister, or a grandchild dies, marries, or becomes 18 years of age, or if over age 18 and incapable of self-support becomes capable of self-support; or

  * (3) a parent or grandparent dies, marries, or ceases to be dependent.


* Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by section 8101 of this title at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries. A widow or widower who has entitlements to benefits under this title derived from more than one husband or wife shall elect one entitlement to be utilized.

* (c) On the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of an individual, the compensation of the remaining individuals entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable, is that which they would have received if they had been the only individuals entitled to compensation at the time of the death of the employee.

* (d) When there are two or more classes of individuals entitled to compensation under this section and the apportionment of compensation under this section would result in injustice, the Secretary may modify the apportionment to meet the requirements of the case.

* (e) In computing compensation under this section, the monthly pay is deemed not less than the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–2. However, the total monthly compensation may not exceed—

  * (1) the monthly pay computed under section 8114 of this title, except for increases authorized by section 8146a of this title; or

  * (2) 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS–15.


* (f) Notwithstanding any funeral and burial expenses paid under section 8134, there shall be paid a sum of $200 to the personal representative of a deceased employee within the meaning of section 8101(1) of this title for reimbursement of the costs of termination of the decedent's status as an employee of the United States.

### §8134. Funeral expenses; transportation of body
* (a) If death results from an injury sustained in the performance of duty, the United States shall pay, to the personal representative of the deceased or otherwise, funeral and burial expenses not to exceed $800, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor.

* (b) The body of an employee whose home is in the United States, in the discretion of the Secretary, may be embalmed and transported in a hermetically sealed casket to his home or last place of residence at the expense of the Employees' Compensation Fund if—

  * (1) the employee dies from—

    * (A) the injury while away from his home or official station or outside the United States; or

    * (B) from other causes while away from his home or official station for the purpose of receiving medical or other services, appliances, supplies, or examination under this subchapter; and


  * (2) the relatives of the employee request the return of his body.


* If the relatives do not request the return of the body of the employee, the Secretary may provide for its disposition and incur and pay from the Employees' Compensation Fund the necessary and reasonable transportation, funeral, and burial expenses.

### §8135. Lump-sum payment
* (a) The liability of the United States for compensation to a beneficiary in the case of death or of permanent total or permanent partial disability may be discharged by a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation computed at 4 percent true discount compounded annually if—

  * (1) the monthly payment to the beneficiary is less than $50 a month;

  * (2) the beneficiary is or is about to become a nonresident of the United States; or

  * (3) the Secretary of Labor determines that it is for the best interest of the beneficiary.


* The probability of the death of the beneficiary before the expiration of the period during which he is entitled to compensation shall be determined according to the most current United States Life Tables, as developed by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which shall be updated from time to time, but the lump-sum payment to a widow or widower of the deceased employee may not exceed 60 months' compensation. The probability of the happening of any other contingency affecting the amount or duration of compensation shall be disregarded.

* (b) On remarriage before reaching age 55 a widow or widower entitled to compensation under section 8133 of this title, shall be paid a lump sum equal to twenty-four times the monthly compensation payment (excluding compensation on account of another individual) to which he was entitled immediately before the remarriage.

### §8136. Initial payments outside the United States
* If an employee is injured outside the continental United States, the Secretary of Labor may arrange and provide for initial payment of compensation and initial furnishing of other benefits under this subchapter by an employee or agent of the United States designated by the Secretary for that purpose in the locality in which the employee was employed or the injury occurred.

### §8137. Compensation for noncitizens and nonresidents
* (a) When the Secretary of Labor finds that the amount of compensation payable to an employee who is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States or Canada, or payable to a dependent of such an employee, is substantially disproportionate to compensation for disability or death payable in similar cases under local statute, regulation, custom, or otherwise at the place outside the continental United States or Canada where the employee is working at the time of injury, he may provide for payment of compensation on a basis reasonably in accord with prevailing local payments in similar cases by—

  * (1) the adoption or adaption of the substantive features, by a schedule or otherwise, of local workmen's compensation provisions or other local statute, regulation, or custom applicable in cases of personal injury or death; or

  * (2) establishing special schedules of compensation for injury, death, and loss of use of members and functions of the body for specific classes of employees, areas, and places.


* Irrespective of the basis adopted, the Secretary may at any time—

  * (A) modify or limit the maximum monthly and total aggregate payments for injury, death, and medical or other benefits;

  * (B) modify or limit the percentages of the wage of the employee payable as compensation for the injury or death; and

  * (C) modify, limit, or redesignate the class or classes of beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, including the designation of persons, representatives, or groups entitled to payment under local statute or custom whether or not included in the classes of beneficiaries otherwise specified by this subchapter.


* (b) In a case under this section, the Secretary or his designee may—

  * (1) make a lump-sum award in the manner prescribed by section 8135 of this title when he or his designee considers it to be for the best interest of the United States; and

  * (2) compromise and pay a claim for benefits, including a claim in which there is a dispute as to jurisdiction or other fact or a question of law.


* Compensation paid under this subsection is instead of all other compensation from the United States for the same injury or death, and a payment made under this subsection is deemed compensation under this subchapter and is satisfaction of all liability of the United States in respect to the particular injury or death.

* (c) The Secretary may delegate to an employee or agency of the United States, with such limitations and right of review as he considers advisable, authority to process, adjudicate, commute by lump-sum award, compromise, and pay a claim or class of claims for compensation, and to provide other benefits, locally, under this section, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary.
