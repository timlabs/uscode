  * (2) "law enforcement officer" has the meaning given that term under section 8331(20) or 8401(17).


* (b) Any law enforcement officer who is convicted of a felony shall be removed from employment as a law enforcement officer on the last day of the first applicable pay period following the conviction notice date.

* (c)(1) This section does not prohibit the removal of an individual from employment as a law enforcement officer before a conviction notice date if the removal is properly effected other than under this section.

* (2) This section does not prohibit the employment of any individual in any position other than that of a law enforcement officer.
