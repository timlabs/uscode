### **CHAPTER 15—EGG PRODUCTS INSPECTION**

### §1031. Congressional statement of findings
* Eggs and egg products are an important source of the Nation's total supply of food, and are used in food in various forms. They are consumed throughout the Nation and the major portion thereof moves in interstate or foreign commerce. It is essential, in the public interest, that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by the adoption of measures prescribed herein for assuring that eggs and egg products distributed to them and used in products consumed by them are wholesome, otherwise not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged. Lack of effective regulation for the handling or disposition of unwholesome, otherwise adulterated, or improperly labeled or packaged egg products and certain qualities of eggs is injurious to the public welfare and destroys markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged eggs and egg products and results in sundry losses to producers and processors, as well as injury to consumers. Unwholesome, otherwise adulterated, or improperly labeled or packaged products can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged products, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that all egg products and the qualities of eggs which are regulated under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce, or substantially affect such commerce, and that regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and cooperation by the States and other jurisdictions, as contemplated by this chapter, are appropriate to prevent and eliminate burdens upon such commerce, to effectively regulate such commerce, and to protect the health and welfare of consumers.

### §1032. Congressional declaration of policy
* It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress to provide for the inspection of certain egg products, restrictions upon the disposition of certain qualities of eggs, and uniformity of standards for eggs, and otherwise regulate the processing and distribution of eggs and egg products as hereinafter prescribed to prevent the movement or sale for human food, of eggs and egg products which are adulterated or misbranded or otherwise in violation of this chapter.

* For the purpose of preventing the entry into or flow or movement in commerce of, or the burdening of commerce by, any egg product which is capable of use as human food and is misbranded or adulterated, the Secretary shall, whenever processing operations are being conducted, cause continuous inspection to be made, in accordance with the regulations promulgated under this chapter, of the processing of egg products, in each plant processing egg products for commerce, unless exempted under section 1044 of this title. Without restricting the application of the preceding sentence to other kinds of establishments within its provisions, any food manufacturing establishment, institution, or restaurant which uses any eggs that do not meet the requirements of section 1044(a)(1) of this title in the preparation of any articles for human food shall be deemed to be a plant processing egg products, with respect to such operations.

#### (b) Authority of Secretary to retain, segregate, and reinspect eggs and egg products
* The Secretary, at any time, shall cause such retention, segregation, and reinspection as he deems necessary of eggs and egg products capable of use as human food in each official plant.

* Eggs and egg products found to be adulterated at official plants shall be condemned and, if no appeal be taken from such determination of condemnation, such articles shall be destroyed for human food purposes under the supervision of an inspector: _Provided_, That articles which may by reprocessing be made not adulterated need not be condemned and destroyed if so reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and thereafter found to be not adulterated. If an appeal be taken from such determination, the eggs or egg products shall be appropriately marked and segregated pending completion of an appeal inspection, which appeal shall be at the cost of the appellant if the Secretary determines that the appeal is frivolous. If the determination of condemnation is sustained, the eggs or egg products shall be destroyed for human food purposes under the supervision of an inspector.

#### (d) Inspection of business premises, facilities, inventory, operations, and records of egg handlers; inspection of records and inventory of others required to keep records; authority of Secretary of Health and Human Services to inspect food manufacturing establishments, institutions, and restaurants; access to places of business
* The Secretary shall cause such other inspections to be made of the business premises, facilities, inventory, operations, and records of egg handlers, and the records and inventory of other persons required to keep records under section 1040 of this title, as he deems appropriate (and in the case of shell egg packers, packing eggs for the ultimate consumer, at least once each calendar quarter) to assure that only eggs fit for human food are used for such purpose, and otherwise to assure compliance by egg handlers and other persons with the requirements of section 1037 of this title, except that the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cause such inspections to be made as he deems appropriate to assure compliance with such requirements at food manufacturing establishments, institutions, and restaurants, other than plants processing egg products. Representatives of said Secretaries shall be afforded access to all such places of business for purposes of making the inspections provided for in this chapter.

#### (e) Refrigeration and labeling requirements
* (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the Secretary shall make such inspections as the Secretary considers appropriate of a facility of an egg handler (including a transport vehicle) to determine if shell eggs destined for the ultimate consumer—

  * (A) are being held under refrigeration at an ambient temperature of no greater than 45 degrees Fahrenheit after packing; and

  * (B) contain labeling that indicates that refrigeration is required.


* (2) In the case of a shell egg packer packing eggs for the ultimate consumer, the Secretary shall make an inspection in accordance with paragraph (1) at least once each calendar quarter.

* Each official plant shall be operated in accordance with such sanitary practices and shall have such premises, facilities, and equipment as are required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including requirements for segregation and disposition of restricted eggs.

#### (b) Refusal by Secretary to inspect nonconforming plants

### §1036. Pasteurization and labeling of egg products at official plants
#### (a) Contents of label
* Egg products inspected at any official plant under the authority of this chapter and found to be not adulterated shall be pasteurized before they leave the official plant, except as otherwise permitted by regulations of the Secretary, and shall at the time they leave the official plant, bear in distinctly legible form on their shipping containers or immediate containers, or both, when required by regulations of the Secretary, the official inspection legend and official plant number, of the plant where the products were processed, and such other information as the Secretary may require by regulations to describe the products adequately and to assure that they will not have false or misleading labeling.

#### (b) False or misleading or use of nonapproved labeling or containers; determination by Secretary; procedures applicable; appeal
* No labeling or container shall be used for egg products at official plants if it is false or misleading or has not been approved as required by the regulations of the Secretary. If the Secretary has reason to believe that any labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use with respect to egg products at any official plant is false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that such use be withheld unless the labeling or container is modified in such manner as he may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person using or proposing to use the labeling or container does not accept the determination of the Secretary, such person may request a hearing, but the use of the labeling or container shall, if the Secretary so directs, be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within thirty days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the person adversely affected thereby appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such person has its principal place of business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The provisions of section 194 of title 7, shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.

When a decree of condemnation is entered against the articles and they are released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant thereof. The proceedings in such cases shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims, except that either party may demand trial by jury of any issue of fact joined in any case, and all such proceedings shall be at the suit of and in the name of the United States.
