    * (ii) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available, multiplied by the average proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available; and

    * (iii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC–MD–VA–WV; not seasonally adjusted; all items less food and energy; annual index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years for which data are available multiplied by the average proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available.


  * (B) COMPOUNDED BASIS.—The adjustment made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020 under this paragraph shall be applied on a compounded basis to the revenue amount calculated under this paragraph for the most recent previous fiscal year.

* #### (3) Workload adjustments
  * #### (A) In general
    * For fiscal year 2020 and subsequent fiscal years, after the fee revenue amounts established under subsection (b) are adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (2), the fee revenue amounts shall be further adjusted for such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process for the review of animal drug applications, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C). With respect to such adjustment—

      * (i) such adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications for which data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required, manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications, investigational animal drug study submissions, and investigational animal drug protocol submissions submitted to the Secretary; and

      * (ii) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from such adjustment and the supporting methodologies.

  * #### (B) Reduction of workload-based increase by amount of certain excess collections
    * For each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023, if application of the workload adjustment under subparagraph (A) increases the fee revenue amounts otherwise established for the fiscal year under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2), such fee revenue increase shall be reduced by the amount of any excess collections, as described in subsection (g)(4), for the second preceding fiscal year, up to the amount of such fee revenue increase.

  * #### (C) Rule of application
    * Under no circumstances shall the workload adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2).

* #### (4) Final year adjustment
  * For fiscal year 2023, the Secretary may, in addition to other adjustments under this subsection, further increase the fees under this section, if such an adjustment is necessary, to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of animal drug applications for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2024. If the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the process for the review of animal drug applications in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment will not be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice setting fees for fiscal year 2023.

* #### (5) Limit
  * The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications.

#### (d) Fee waiver or reduction; exemptions from fees
* #### (1) Waiver or reduction
  * The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that—

    * (A) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances;

    * (B) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for the review of animal drug applications for such person;

    * (C) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for use of the animal drug in—

      * (i) a Type B medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(3) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation)) intended for use in the manufacture of Type C free-choice medicated feeds; or

      * (ii) a Type C free-choice medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(4) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation));


    * (D) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication; or

    * (E) the sponsor involved is a small business submitting its first animal drug application to the Secretary for review.

* #### (2) Use of standard costs
  * In making the finding in paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary may use standard costs.

* #### (3) Rules for small businesses
  * #### (A) Definition
    * In paragraph (1)(E), the term "small business" means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates.

  * #### (B) Waiver of application fee
    * The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(E) the application fee for the first animal drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent animal drug applications and supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or effectiveness data are required in the same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small business.

  * #### (C) Certification

      * (ii) otherwise would be subject to fees under this section solely on the basis of such supplemental application.

  * #### (B) Certain animal drug applications
    * Fees under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any person who is the named applicant or sponsor of an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission if such application or submission involves the intentional genomic alteration of an animal that is intended to produce a drug, device, or biological product subject to fees under section 379h, 379j, 379j–42, or 379j–52 of this title.

Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of animal drug applications.

* #### (3) Authorization of appropriations
  * For each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount established under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c) and paragraph (5).

* #### (4) Excess collections
  * If the sum total of fees collected under this section for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of fees authorized to be appropriated for such year under paragraph (3), the excess collections shall be credited to the appropriations account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1).
