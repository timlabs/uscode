* shall, during, or in advance of, a public health emergency declared by the Secretary under section 247d of title 42, notify the Secretary, in accordance with subsection (b), of a permanent discontinuance in the manufacture of the device (except for discontinuances as a result of an approved modification of the device) or an interruption of the manufacture of the device that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply of that device in the United States, and the reasons for such discontinuance or interruption.

#### (b) Timing
* A notice required under subsection (a) shall be submitted to the Secretary—

  * (1) at least 6 months prior to the date of the discontinuance or interruption; or

* #### (2) Public health exception
  * The Secretary may choose not to make information collected under this section publicly available pursuant to this section if the Secretary determines that disclosure of such information would adversely affect the public health, such as by increasing the possibility of unnecessary over purchase of product, component parts, or other disruption of the availability of medical products to patients.

      * (ii) Regulatory delay.

      * (iii) Shortage or discontinuance of a component or part.

      * (iv) Discontinuance of the manufacture of the device.

      * (v) Delay in shipping of the device.

#### (i) Definitions
* In this section:

* #### (1) Meaningful disruption
  * The term "meaningful disruption"—

    * (A) means a change in production that is reasonably likely to lead to a reduction in the supply of a device by a manufacturer that is more than negligible and affects the ability of the manufacturer to fill orders or meet expected demand for its product;

    * (B) does not include interruptions in manufacturing due to matters such as routine maintenance or insignificant changes in manufacturing so long as the manufacturer expects to resume operations in a short period of time, not to exceed 6 months;

    * (C) does not include interruptions in manufacturing of components or raw materials so long as such interruptions do not result in a shortage of the device and the manufacturer expects to resume operations in a reasonable period of time; and

    * (D) does not include interruptions in manufacturing that do not lead to a reduction in procedures or diagnostic tests associated with a medical device designed to perform more than one procedure or diagnostic test.

* #### (2) Shortage
  * The term "shortage", with respect to a device, means a period of time when the demand or projected demand for the device within the United States exceeds the supply of the device.
