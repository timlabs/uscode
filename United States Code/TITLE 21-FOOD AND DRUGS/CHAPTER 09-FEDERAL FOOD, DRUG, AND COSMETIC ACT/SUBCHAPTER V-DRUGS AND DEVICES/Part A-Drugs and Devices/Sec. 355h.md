    * If the sponsor fails to provide such additional information within a time prescribed by the Secretary, or if the Secretary determines that such additional information does not demonstrate that the change does not—

      * (i) affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug; or

      * (ii) materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to the active ingredient in comparison to a suitable reference product,


  * the drug as modified is a new drug under section 321(p) of this title and shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 352(ee) of this title.

* #### (3) Determining whether a change will affect safety or effectiveness
  * #### (A) In general
    * The Secretary shall issue one or more administrative orders specifying requirements for determining whether a minor change made by a sponsor pursuant to this subsection will affect the safety or effectiveness of a drug or materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to an active ingredient in the drug in comparison to a suitable reference product, together with guidance for applying those orders to specific dosage forms.

  * #### (B) Standard practices
    * The orders and guidance issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall take into account relevant public standards and standard practices for evaluating the quality of drugs, and may take into account the special needs of populations, including children.

      * (ii) the information is submitted in a requestor-initiated request, but the requestor withdraws such request, in accordance with withdrawal procedures established by the Secretary, before the Secretary issues the proposed order;

* The provisions of this section shall not be construed to preclude a person from seeking or maintaining the approval of an application for a drug under sections 355(b)(1), 355(b)(2), and 355(j) of this title. A determination under this section that a drug is not subject to section 353(b)(1) of this title, is generally recognized as safe and effective under section 321(p)(1) of this title, and is not a new drug under section 321(p) of this title shall constitute a finding that the drug is safe and effective that may be relied upon for purposes of an application under section 355(b)(2) of this title, so that the applicant shall be required to submit for purposes of such application only information needed to support any modification of the drug that is not covered by such determination under this section.
