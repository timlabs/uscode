  * #### (A) In general
    * #### (i) Approved uses
      * A designated medical gas for which a certification is granted under paragraph (2) is deemed, alone or in combination, as medically appropriate, with another designated medical gas or gases for which a certification or certifications have been granted, to have in effect an approved application under section 355 or 360b of this title, subject to all applicable postapproval requirements, for the following indications for use:
