#### (a) Definitions
* In this section—

  * "major violent crime or drug-related emergency" means an occasion or instance in which violent crime, drug smuggling, drug trafficking, or drug abuse violence reaches such levels, as determined by the President, that Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives, and to protect property and public health and safety.

  * "State" means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

#### (b) Declaration of violent crime and drug emergency areas

One or more cities, counties, States, or the District of Columbia may submit a joint request for designation as a major violent crime or drug emergency area under this subsection.

* #### (2) Finding

#### (d) Irrelevancy of population density

  * (2) submit a detailed plan outlining that government's short- and long-term plans to respond to the violent crime or drug emergency, specifying the types and levels of Federal assistance requested and including explicit goals (including quantitative goals) and timetables; and

  * (3) specify how Federal assistance provided under this section is intended to achieve those goals.
