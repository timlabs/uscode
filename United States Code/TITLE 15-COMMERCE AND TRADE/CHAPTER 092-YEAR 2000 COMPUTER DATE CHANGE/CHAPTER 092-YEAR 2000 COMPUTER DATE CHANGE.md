### **CHAPTER 92—YEAR 2000 COMPUTER DATE CHANGE**

### §6601. Findings and purposes
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds the following:

  * (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December 31, 1999.

  * (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and defense systems, in the United States and throughout the world.

  * (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users of technology products concentrate their attention and resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions associated with computer failures.

  * (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.

  * (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have a range of undesirable effects, including the following:

    * (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems remain or become operational.

    * (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted business and customer relationships that are important to the effective functioning of the national economy.

    * (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing particular problems for the small businesses and individuals who already find that system inaccessible because of its complexity and expense.

    * (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the difficulties associated with the date change and work against the successful resolution of those difficulties.


  * (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation to assure that the year 2000 problems described in this section do not unnecessarily disrupt interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially devastating economic impact of such problems.

  * (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of year 2000 problems described in this section is not feasible for many businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly small businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.

  * (6) Concern about the potential for liability—in particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense associated with defending against even the most insubstantial lawsuits—is prompting many persons and businesses with technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year 2000 computer date-change problems.

  * (7) A proliferation of frivolous lawsuits relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by straining the resources of the legal system and depriving deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.

  * (8) Congress encourages businesses to approach their disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly litigation about Y2K failures, particularly those that are not material. Congress supports good faith negotiations between parties when there is such a dispute, and, if necessary, urges the parties to enter into voluntary, nonbinding mediation rather than litigation.

#### (b) Purposes
* Based upon the power of the Congress under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this chapter are—

  * (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all businesses and users of technology products reasonable incentives to solve year 2000 computer date-change problems before they develop;

  * (2) to encourage continued remediation and testing efforts to solve such problems by providers, suppliers, customers, and other contracting partners;

  * (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to resolve disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by alternative dispute mechanisms in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to encourage the prompt identification and correction of such problems; and

  * (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real injury to obtain complete relief.

  * If the prospective defendant responds and proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional 60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete the proposed remedial action or alternative dispute resolution before commencing a legal action against that prospective defendant.

* #### (2) Extension by agreement
  * The prospective plaintiff and prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day remediation period by written agreement.

* #### (3) Multiple extensions not allowed
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period under paragraph (1).

* #### (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled
  * Any applicable statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the notice and remediation period under that paragraph.

#### (f) Failure to provide notice
* If a defendant determines that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the plaintiff in its initial response to the plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice—

  * (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after filing of the complaint; and

  * (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings shall be tolled during the appropriate period.

#### (g) Effect of contractual or statutory waiting periods
* In cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before January 1, 1999, requires notice of nonperformance and provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).

#### (h) State law controls alternative methods
* Nothing in this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.

#### (i) Provisional remedies unaffected
* Nothing in this section interferes with the right of a litigant to provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both injunctive and monetary relief.

#### (j) Special rule for class actions
* For the purpose of applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named plaintiffs in the class action.

### §6607. Pleading requirements
#### (a) Application with rules of civil procedure
* This section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the extent that this section requires additional information to be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.

#### (b) Nature and amount of damages
* In all Y2K actions in which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the complaint a statement of specific information as to the nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual basis for the damages calculation.

#### (c) Material defects
* In any Y2K action in which the plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a statement of specific information regarding the manifestations of the material defects and the facts supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.

#### (d) Required state of mind
* In any Y2K action in which a claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.

### §6608. Duty to mitigate
#### (a) In general
* Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, aware, including information made available by the defendant to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure involved in the action.

#### (b) Preservation of existing law
* The duty imposed by this section is in addition to any duty to mitigate imposed by State law.

#### (c) Exception for intentional fraud
* Subsection (a) does not apply to damages suffered by reason of the plaintiff's justifiable reliance upon an affirmative material misrepresentation by the defendant, made by the defendant with actual knowledge of its falsity, concerning the potential for Y2K failure of the device or system used or sold by the defendant that experienced the Y2K failure alleged to have caused the plaintiff's harm.

### §6609. Application of existing impossibility or commercial impracticability doctrines
* In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert defenses based upon such doctrines.

### §6610. Damages limitation by contract
* In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no party may claim, or be awarded, any category of damages unless such damages are allowed—

  * (1) by the express terms of the contract; or

  * (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation of State law at the time the contract was effective or by operation of Federal law.

### §6611. Damages in tort claims
#### (a) In general
* A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim, other than a claim of intentional tort arising independent of a contract, may not recover damages for economic loss unless—

  * (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is a party; or

  * (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure involved in the action (other than damage to property that is the subject of the contract between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),


* and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or State law.

#### (b) Economic loss
* For purposes of this section only, and except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the defendant in a Y2K action, the term "economic loss" means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party for any loss, and includes amounts awarded for damages such as—

  * (1) lost profits or sales;

  * (2) business interruption;

  * (3) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the defendant's wrongful act or omission;

  * (4) losses that arise because of the claims of third parties;

  * (5) losses that must be pled as special damages; and

  * (6) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).

#### (c) Certain other actions
* A person liable for damages, whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which this chapter does not apply because of section 6603(c) of this title whose liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.

### §6612. State of mind; bystander liability; control
#### (a) Defendant's state of mind
* In a Y2K action other than a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that element of the claim by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before January 1, 1999.

#### (b) Limitation on bystander liability for Y2K failures
* #### (1) In general
  * With respect to any Y2K action for money damages in which—

    * (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;

    * (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the defendant; and

    * (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law,


* the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the claim, proves, by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before January 1, 1999, that the defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.

* #### (2) Substantial privity
  * For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the services were being performed.

* #### (3) Certain claims excluded
  * For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law do not include claims for negligence but do include claims such as fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract or economic advantage.

#### (c) Control not determinative of liability
* The fact that a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or otherwise within the control of the party against whom a claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a failure is governed by the terms of the contract.

#### (d) Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act apply
* The protections for the exchanges of information provided by section 4 of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act (Public Law 105–271) shall apply to any Y2K action.

### §6613. Appointment of special masters or magistrate judges for Y2K actions
* Any district court of the United States in which a Y2K action is pending may appoint a special master or a magistrate judge to hear the matter and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

### §6614. Y2K actions as class actions
#### (a) Material defect requirement
* A Y2K action involving a claim that a product or service is defective may be maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to that claim only if—

  * (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules of civil procedure; and

  * (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the members of the class.

#### (b) Notification
* In any Y2K action that is maintained as a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall include—

  * (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the action;

  * (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and

  * (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the percentage of the final award which will be paid, including an estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the requested damages were to be granted.

#### (c) Forum for Y2K class actions
* #### (1) Jurisdiction
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of any Y2K action that is brought as a class action.

* #### (2) Exceptions
  * The district courts of the United States shall not have original jurisdiction over a Y2K action brought as a class action if—

    * (A)(i) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;

    * (ii) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and

    * (iii) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the laws of that State;

    * (B) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other governmental entities against whom the district courts of the United States may be foreclosed from ordering relief;

    * (C) the plaintiff class does not seek an award of punitive damages, and the amount in controversy is less than the sum of $10,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the action; or

    * (D) there are less than 100 members of the proposed plaintiff class.


* A party urging that any exception described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) applies to an action shall bear the full burden of demonstrating the applicability of the exception.

* #### (3) Procedure if requirements not met
  * #### (A) Dismissal or remand
    * A United States district court shall dismiss, or, if after removal, strike the class allegations and remand, any Y2K action brought or removed under this subsection as a class action if—

      * (i) the action is subject to the jurisdiction of the court solely under this subsection; and

      * (ii) the court determines the action may not proceed as a class action based on a failure to satisfy the conditions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

  * #### (B) Amendment; removal
    * Nothing in paragraph (A) shall prohibit plaintiffs from filing an amended class action in Federal or State court. A defendant shall have the right to remove such an amended class action to a United States district court under this subsection.

  * #### (C) Period of limitations tolled
    * Upon dismissal or remand, the period of limitations for any claim that was asserted in an action on behalf of any named or unnamed member of any proposed class shall be deemed tolled to the full extent provided under Federal law.

  * #### (D) Dismissal without prejudice
    * The dismissal of a Y2K action under subparagraph (A) shall be without prejudice.

#### (d) Effect on rules of civil procedure
* Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section supersedes any rule of Federal or State civil procedure applicable to class actions.

### §6615. Applicability of State law
* Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the applicability of any State law that provides stricter limits on damages and liabilities, affording greater protection to defendants in Y2K actions, than are provided in this chapter.

### §6616. Admissible evidence ultimate issue in State courts
* Any party to a Y2K action in a State court in a State that has not adopted a rule of evidence substantially similar to Rule 704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence may introduce in such action evidence that would be admissible if Rule 704 applied in that jurisdiction.

### §6617. Suspension of penalties for certain year 2000 failures by small business concerns
#### (a) Definitions
* In this section—

  * (1) the term "agency" means any executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5, that has the authority to impose civil penalties on small business concerns;

  * (2) the term "first-time violation" means a violation by a small business concern of a federally enforceable rule or regulation (other than a Federal rule or regulation that relates to the safety and soundness of the banking or monetary system or for the integrity of the National Securities markets, including protection of depositors and investors) caused by a Y2K failure if that Federal rule or regulation had not been violated by that small business concern within the preceding 3 years; and

  * (3) the term "small business concern" has the same meaning as a defendant described in section 6604(b)(2)(B) of this title.

#### (b) Establishment of liaisons
* Not later than 30 days after July 20, 1999, each agency shall—

  * (2) publish the name and phone number of the point of contact for the agency in the Federal Register.

#### (c) General rule
* Subject to subsections (d) and (e), no agency shall impose any civil money penalty on a small business concern for a first-time violation.

#### (d) Standards for waiver
* An agency shall provide a waiver of civil money penalties for a first-time violation, provided that a small business concern demonstrates, and the agency determines, that—

  * (1) the small business concern previously made a reasonable good faith effort to anticipate, prevent, and effectively remediate a potential Y2K failure;

  * (2) a first-time violation occurred as a result of the Y2K failure of the small business concern or other entity, which significantly affected the small business concern's ability to comply with a Federal rule or regulation;

  * (3) the first-time violation was unavoidable in the face of a Y2K failure or occurred as a result of efforts to prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that could result in harm to life or property;

  * (4) upon identification of a first-time violation, the small business concern initiated reasonable and prompt measures to correct the violation; and

  * (5) the small business concern submitted notice to the appropriate agency of the first-time violation within a reasonable time not to exceed 5 business days from the time that the small business concern became aware that the first-time violation had occurred.

#### (e) Exceptions
* An agency may impose civil money penalties authorized under Federal law on a small business concern for a first-time violation if—

  * (1) the small business concern's failure to comply with Federal rules or regulations resulted in actual harm, or constitutes or creates an imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment; or

  * (2) the small business concern fails to correct the violation not later than 1 month after initial notification to the agency.

#### (f) Expiration
