### **CHAPTER 63—TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION**

### §3701. Findings
* The Congress finds and declares that:

  * (1) Technology and industrial innovation are central to the economic, environmental, and social well-being of citizens of the United States.

  * (2) Technology and industrial innovation offer an improved standard of living, increased public and private sector productivity, creation of new industries and employment opportunities, improved public services and enhanced competitiveness of United States products in world markets.

  * (3) Many new discoveries and advances in science occur in universities and Federal laboratories, while the application of this new knowledge to commercial and useful public purposes depends largely upon actions by business and labor. Cooperation among academia, Federal laboratories, labor, and industry, in such forms as technology transfer, personnel exchange, joint research projects, and others, should be renewed, expanded, and strengthened.

  * (4) Small businesses have performed an important role in advancing industrial and technological innovation.

  * (5) Industrial and technological innovation in the United States may be lagging when compared to historical patterns and other industrialized nations.

  * (6) Increased industrial and technological innovation would reduce trade deficits, stabilize the dollar, increase productivity gains, increase employment, and stabilize prices.

  * (7) Government antitrust, economic, trade, patent, procurement, regulatory, research and development, and tax policies have significant impacts upon industrial innovation and development of technology, but there is insufficient knowledge of their effects in particular sectors of the economy.

  * (8) No comprehensive national policy exists to enhance technological innovation for commercial and public purposes. There is a need for such a policy, including a strong national policy supporting domestic technology transfer and utilization of the science and technology resources of the Federal Government.

  * (9) It is in the national interest to promote the adaptation of technological innovations to State and local government uses. Technological innovations can improve services, reduce their costs, and increase productivity in State and local governments.

  * (10) The Federal laboratories and other performers of federally funded research and development frequently provide scientific and technological developments of potential use to State and local governments and private industry. These developments, which include inventions, computer software, and training technologies, should be made accessible to those governments and industry. There is a need to provide means of access and to give adequate personnel and funding support to these means.

  * (11) The Nation should give fuller recognition to individuals and companies which have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of technology or technological manpower for the improvement of the economic, environmental, or social well-being of the United States.

### §3702. Purpose
* It is the purpose of this chapter to improve the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the United States by—

  * (1) establishing organizations in the executive branch to study and stimulate technology;

  * (2) promoting technology development through the establishment of cooperative research centers;

  * (3) stimulating improved utilization of federally funded technology developments, including inventions, software, and training technologies, by State and local governments and the private sector;

  * (4) providing encouragement for the development of technology through the recognition of individuals and companies which have made outstanding contributions in technology; and

  * (5) encouraging the exchange of scientific and technical personnel among academia, industry, and Federal laboratories.
