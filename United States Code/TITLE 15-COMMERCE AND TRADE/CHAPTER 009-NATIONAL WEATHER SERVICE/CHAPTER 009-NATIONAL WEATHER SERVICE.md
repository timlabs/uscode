### §313c. Authorized activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the United States Weather Research Program, shall—

  * (1) improve the capability to accurately forecast inland flooding (including inland flooding influenced by coastal and ocean storms) through research and modeling;

  * (4) conduct outreach and education activities for local meteorologists and the public regarding the dangers and risks associated with inland flooding and the use and understanding of the inland flood warning index developed under paragraph (2); and

  * (5) assess, through research and analysis of previous trends, among other activities—

    * (A) the long-term trends in frequency and severity of inland flooding; and

    * (B) how shifts in climate, development, and erosion patterns might make certain regions vulnerable to more continual or escalating flood damage in the future.

### §313d. NIDIS program
#### (a) In general
* The Under Secretary, through the National Weather Service and other appropriate weather and climate programs in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall establish a National Integrated Drought Information System to better inform and provide for more timely decisionmaking to reduce drought related impacts and costs.

#### (b) System functions
* The National Integrated Drought Information System shall—

  * (1) provide an effective drought early warning system that—

    * (A) collects and integrates information on the key indicators of drought and drought impacts, including precipitation, soil moisture, and evaporative demand, in order to make usable, reliable, and timely forecasts of drought and assessments of the severity of drought conditions and impacts; and

    * (B) provides such information, forecasts, and assessments on both national and regional levels;

  * (4) coordinate, and integrate, through interagency agreements as practicable, Federal research and monitoring in support of a drought early warning information system;

  * (5) utilize existing forecasting and assessment programs and partnerships, including forecast communication coordinators and cooperative institutes, and improvements in seasonal precipitation and temperature, subseasonal precipitation and temperature, and low flow water prediction; and

  * (6) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought, including research activities relating to the prediction, length, severity, and impacts of drought and the role of extreme weather events and climate variability in drought.

#### (c) Partnerships
* The National Integrated Drought Information System may—

  * (1) engage with the private sector to improve drought monitoring, forecast, and communication if the Under Secretary determines the partnership is appropriate, cost-effective, and beneficial to the public and decisionmakers described in subsection (b)(2)(A);

  * (2) facilitate the development of 1 or more academic cooperative partnerships to assist with National Integrated Drought Information System functions; and
