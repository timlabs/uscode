In making such examination, the Director or anyone designated by him shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the developer, any agents or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination. If the developer or any agents shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of an order suspending the statement of record.

#### (f) Service of notices

### §1707. Property report
#### (a) Contents of report

No person may advertise or represent that the Director approves or recommends the subdivision or the sale or lease of lots therein. No portion of the property report shall be underscored, italicized, or printed in larger or bolder type than the balance of the statement unless the Director requires or permits it.

### §1708. Certification of substantially equivalent State law
#### (a) Criteria; request by State
* (1) A State shall be certified if the Director determines—

  * (A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title require the seller or lessor of such lots to disclose information which is at least substantially equivalent to the information required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title; and

  * (B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that such information is accurate.


* (2) In the case of any State which is not certified under paragraph (1), such State shall be certified if the Director determines—

  * (A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title provide sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees with respect to the matters for which information is required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title but which is not required to be disclosed by such State's laws and regulations; and

Such property report shall be the only property report required by the State with respect to the sale or lease of such land.

The Director may accept for such filing, and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report, such materials and documentation found acceptable by the State in connection with the sale or lease of lots located outside that State. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from exercising the authority conferred by subsections (d) and (e) of section 1706 of this title.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Director, and thereupon the Director shall file in the court the record upon which the order or determination complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. No objection to an order or determination of the Director shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Director.

If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Director, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Director and to be adduced upon a hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Director may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. Upon the filing of such petition, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Director, shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
