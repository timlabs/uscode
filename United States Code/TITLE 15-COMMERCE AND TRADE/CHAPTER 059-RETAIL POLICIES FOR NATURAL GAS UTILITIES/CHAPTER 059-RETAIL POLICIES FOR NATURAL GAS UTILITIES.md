### **CHAPTER 59—RETAIL POLICIES FOR NATURAL GAS UTILITIES**

### §3201. Purposes; coverage
#### (a) Purposes
* The purposes of this chapter are to encourage—

  * (1) conservation of energy supplied by gas utilities;

  * (2) the optimization of the efficiency of use of facilities and resources by gas utility systems; and

  * (3) equitable rates to gas consumers of natural gas.

#### (b) Volume of total retail sales
* This chapter applies to each gas utility in any calendar year, and to each proceeding relating to each gas utility in such year, if the total sales of natural gas by such utility for purposes other than resale exceeded 10 billion cubic feet during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding calendar year.

#### (c) Exclusion of wholesale sales
* The requirements of this chapter do not apply to the operations of a gas utility, or to proceedings respecting such operations, to the extent that such operations or proceedings relate to sales of natural gas for purposes of resale.

#### (d) List of covered utilities
* Before the beginning of each calendar year, the Secretary shall publish a list identifying each gas utility to which this chapter applies during such calendar year. Promptly after publication of such list, each State regulatory authority shall notify the Secretary of each gas utility on the list for which such State regulatory authority has ratemaking authority.

### §3202. Definitions
* For purposes of this chapter—

  * (1) The term "gas consumer" means any person, State agency, or Federal agency, to which natural gas is sold other than for purposes of resale.

  * (2) The term "gas utility" means any person, State agency, or Federal agency, engaged in the local distribution of natural gas, and the sale of natural gas to any ultimate consumer of natural gas.

  * (3) The term "State regulated gas utility" means any gas utility with respect to which a State regulatory authority has ratemaking authority.

  * (4) The term "nonregulated gas utility" means any gas utility other than a State regulated gas utility.

  * (5) The term "rate" means any (A) price, rate, charge, or classification made, demanded, observed, or received with respect to sale of natural gas to a gas consumer, (B) any rule, regulation, or practice respecting any such rate, charge, or classification, and (C) any contract pertaining to the sale of natural gas to a gas consumer.

  * (6) The term "ratemaking authority" means authority to fix, modify, approve, or disapprove rates.

  * (7) The term "sale" when used with respect to natural gas, includes an exchange of natural gas.

  * (8) The term "State regulatory authority" means any State agency which has ratemaking authority with respect to the sale of natural gas by any gas utility (other than by such State agency).

  * (9) The term "integrated resource planning" means, in the case of a gas utility, planning by the use of any standard, regulation, practice, or policy to undertake a systematic comparison between demand-side management measures and the supply of gas by a gas utility to minimize life-cycle costs of adequate and reliable utility services to gas consumers. Integrated resource planning shall take into account necessary features for system operation such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk and shall treat demand and supply to gas consumers on a consistent and integrated basis.

  * (10) The term "demand-side management" includes energy conservation, energy efficiency, and load management techniques.

### §3203. Adoption of certain standards
#### (a) Adoption of standards
* Not later than 2 years after November 9, 1978 (or after October 24, 1992, in the case of standards under paragraphs (3), and (4) of subsection (b)), each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility shall provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standards established by subsection (b), and, on the basis of such hearing, shall—

  * (1) adopt the standard established by subsection (b)(1), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law, and

  * (2) adopt the standards established by paragraphs (2), (3) (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (b), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, is otherwise appropriate, and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law.


* For purposes of any determination under paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review of such determination in any court under section 3207 of this title, the purposes of this chapter supplement State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.

#### (b) Establishment
* The following Federal standards are hereby established:

* #### (1) Procedures for termination of natural gas service
  * No gas utility may terminate natural gas service to any gas consumer except pursuant to procedures described in section 3204(a) of this title.

* #### (2) Advertising
  * No gas utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as defined in section 3204(b) of this title.

* #### (3) Integrated resource planning
  * Each gas utility shall employ, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its gas customers at the lowest system cost. All plans or filings of a State regulated gas utility before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall (A) be updated on a regular basis, (B) provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, (C) provide for methods of validating predicted performance, and (D) contain a requirement that the plan be implemented after approval of the State regulatory authority. Subsection (c) shall not apply to this paragraph to the extent that it could be construed to require the State regulatory authority to extend the record of a State proceeding in submitting reports to the Federal Government.

* #### (4) Investments in conservation and demand management
  * The rates charged by any State regulated gas utility shall be such that the utility's prudent investments in, and expenditures for, energy conservation and load shifting programs and for other demand-side management measures which are consistent with the findings and purposes of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 are at least as profitable (taking into account the income lost due to reduced sales resulting from such programs) as prudent investments in, and expenditures for, the acquisition or construction of supplies and facilities. This objective requires that (A) regulators link the utility's net revenues, at least in part, to the utility's performance in implementing cost-effective programs promoted by this section; and (B) regulators ensure that, for purposes of recovering fixed costs, including its authorized return, the utility's performance is not affected by reductions in its retail sales volumes.

* #### (5) Energy efficiency
  * Each natural gas utility shall—

    * (A) integrate energy efficiency resources into the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility; and

    * (B) adopt policies that establish energy efficiency as a priority resource in the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility.

* #### (6) Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments
  * #### (A) In general
    * The rates allowed to be charged by a natural gas utility shall align utility incentives with the deployment of cost-effective energy efficiency.

  * #### (B) Policy options
    * In complying with subparagraph (A), each State regulatory authority and each nonregulated utility shall consider—

      * (i) separating fixed-cost revenue recovery from the volume of transportation or sales service provided to the customer;

      * (ii) providing to utilities incentives for the successful management of energy efficiency programs, such as allowing utilities to retain a portion of the cost-reducing benefits accruing from the programs;

      * (iii) promoting the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as 1 of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; and

      * (iv) adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class.


  * For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter to this paragraph, any reference in this chapter to November 9, 1978, shall be treated as a reference to December 19, 2007.

#### (c) Procedural requirements
* Each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility, within the 2-year period specified in subsection (a), shall adopt, pursuant to subsection (a), each of the standards established by subsection (b), or, with respect to any such standard which is not adopted, such authority or nonregulated gas utility shall state in writing that it has determined not to adopt such standard, together with the reasons for such determination. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.

#### (d) Small business impacts
* If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (b)(3) or (4), such authority shall—

  * (1) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other demand-side management measures, and

  * (2) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.

### §3204. Special rules for standards
#### (a) Procedures for termination of gas service
* The procedures for termination of service referred to in section 3203(b)(1) of this title are procedures prescribed by the State regulatory authority (with respect to gas utilities for which it has ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated gas utility which provide that—

  * (1) no gas service to a gas consumer may be terminated unless reasonable prior notice (including notice of rights and remedies) is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination, and

  * (2) during any period when termination of service to a gas consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated gas utility, and such consumer establishes that—

    * (A) he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility's billing, or

    * (B) he is able to pay for such service but only in installments,


* such service may not be terminated.


* Such procedures shall take into account the need to include reasonable provisions for elderly and handicapped consumers.
