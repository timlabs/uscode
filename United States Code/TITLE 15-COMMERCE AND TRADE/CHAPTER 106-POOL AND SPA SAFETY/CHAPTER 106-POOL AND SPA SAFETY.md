### **CHAPTER 106—POOL AND SPA SAFETY**

### §8001. Findings
* Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Of injury-related deaths, drowning is the second leading cause of death in children aged 1 to 14 in the United States.

  * (2) In 2004, 761 children aged 14 and under died as a result of unintentional drowning.

  * (3) Adult supervision at all aquatic venues is a critical safety factor in preventing children from drowning.

  * (4) Research studies show that the installation and proper use of barriers or fencing, as well as additional layers of protection, could substantially reduce the number of childhood residential swimming pool drownings and near drownings.

### §8002. Definitions
