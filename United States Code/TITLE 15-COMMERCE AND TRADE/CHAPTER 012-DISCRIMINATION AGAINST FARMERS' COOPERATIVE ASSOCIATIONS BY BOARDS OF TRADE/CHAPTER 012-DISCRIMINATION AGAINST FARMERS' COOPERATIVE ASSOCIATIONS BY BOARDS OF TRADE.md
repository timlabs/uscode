### **CHAPTER 12—DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FARMERS' COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS BY BOARDS OF TRADE**

### §431. Definitions
* When used in this chapter (a) the term "agricultural products", means agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, food products of livestock, the products of poultry and bee raising, the edible products of forestry, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and processed or manufactured products thereof, transported or intended to be transported in interstate and/or foreign commerce.

* (b) The words "board of trade" shall be held to include and mean any exchange or association, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of persons who shall be engaged in the business of buying or selling agricultural products or receiving the same for sale on consignment, except markets designated as contract markets under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].

* (c) The words "interstate commerce" shall be construed to mean commerce between any State, Territory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, and any place outside thereof; or between points within the same State, Territory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, but through any place outside thereof, or within any Territory or possession, or the District of Columbia.

* (d) For the purposes of this chapter (but not in any wise limiting the foregoing definition of interstate commerce) a transaction in respect to any article shall be considered to be in interstate commerce if such article is part of that current of commerce usual in dealing in agricultural products whereby they are sent from one State with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase, in another, including, in addition to cases within the above general description, all cases where purchase or sale is either for shipment to another State or for manufacture within the State and the shipment outside the State of the products resulting from such manufacture. Articles normally in such current of commerce shall not be considered out of such commerce through resort being had to any means or device intended to remove transactions in respect thereto from the provisions of this chapter. For the purpose of this paragraph the word "State" includes Territory, the District of Columbia, possession of the United States, and foreign nation.

* (e) The word "person" shall be construed to import the plural or singular, and shall include individuals, associations, partnerships, corporations, and trusts.

* (f) The act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust, within the scope of his employment or office, shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust, as well as of such official, agent, or other person.

### §432. Boards of trade dealing in agricultural products; exclusion of representatives of cooperative associations prohibited
* No board of trade whose members are engaged in the business of buying or selling agricultural products or receiving the same for sale on consignment in interstate commerce shall exclude from membership in, and all privileges on, such board of trade, any duly authorized representative of any lawfully formed and conducted cooperative association, corporate or otherwise, composed substantially of producers of agricultural products, or any such representative of any organization acting for a group of such associations, if such association or organization has adequate financial responsibility and complies or agrees to comply with such terms and conditions as are or may be imposed lawfully on other members of such board: _Provided_, That no rule of a board of trade shall forbid or be construed to forbid the return on a patronage basis by such cooperative association or organization to its bona fide members of moneys collected in excess of the expense of conducting the business of such association.

### §433. Remedies of cooperative association excluded from representation
* Any such cooperative association or any such organization whose duly authorized representative is excluded from such membership and privileges by any board of trade referred to in section 432 of this title may sue in the United States District Court in whose jurisdiction such board of trade is operated or maintained for a mandatory injunction compelling such board of trade to admit such duly authorized representative to such membership and privileges and for any damages sustained, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such an injunction and to award such incidental damages as it may deem appropriate.
