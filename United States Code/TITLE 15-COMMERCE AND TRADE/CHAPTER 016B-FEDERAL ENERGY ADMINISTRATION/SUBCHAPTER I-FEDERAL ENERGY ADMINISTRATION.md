### SUBCHAPTER I—FEDERAL ENERGY ADMINISTRATION

### §761. Congressional declaration of purpose
#### (a) Objectives
* The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and the common defense and security require positive and effective action to conserve scarce energy supplies, to insure fair and efficient distribution of, and the maintenance of fair and reasonable consumer prices for, such supplies, to promote the expansion of readily usable energy sources, and to assist in developing policies and plans to meet the energy needs of the Nation.

#### (b) Necessity for reorganization
* The Congress finds that to help achieve these objectives, and to assure a coordinated and effective approach to overcoming energy shortages, it is necessary to reorganize certain agencies and functions of the executive branch and to establish a Federal Energy Administration.

#### (c) Creation of Federal Energy Administration
* The sole purpose of this chapter is to create an administration in the executive branch, called the Federal Energy Administration, to vest in the Administration certain functions as provided in this chapter, and to transfer to such Administration certain executive branch functions authorized by other laws, where such transfer is necessary on an interim basis to deal with the Nation's energy shortages.

### §762. Establishment
* There is hereby established an independent agency in the executive branch to be known as the Federal Energy Administration (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the "Administration").

### §764. Specific functions and purposes
#### (a) Limitation on discretionary powers
* Subject to the provisions and procedures set forth in this chapter, the Administrator shall be responsible for such actions as are taken to assure that adequate provision is made to meet the energy needs of the Nation. To that end, he shall make such plans and direct and conduct such programs related to the production, conservation, use, control, distribution, rationing, and allocation of all forms of energy as are appropriate in connection with only those authorities or functions—

  * (1) specifically transferred to or vested in him by or pursuant to this chapter;

  * (2) delegated to him by the President pursuant to specific authority vested in the President by law; and

  * (3) otherwise specifically vested in the Administrator by the Congress.

#### (b) Duties
* To the extent authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall—

  * (1) advise the President and the Congress with respect to the establishment of a comprehensive national energy policy in relation to the energy matters for which the Administration has responsibility, and, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the integration of domestic and foreign policies relating to energy resource management;

  * (2) assess the adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the immediate and longer range future for all sectors of the economy and for the general public;

  * (3) develop effective arrangements for the participation of State and local governments in the resolution of energy problems;

  * (4) develop plans and programs for dealing with energy production shortages;

  * (5) promote stability in energy prices to the consumer, promote free and open competition in all aspects of the energy field, prevent unreasonable profits within the various segments of the energy industry, and promote free enterprise;

  * (6) assure that energy programs are designed and implemented in a fair and efficient manner so as to minimize hardship and inequity while assuring that the priority needs of the Nation are met;

  * (7) develop and oversee the implementation of equitable voluntary and mandatory energy conservation programs and promote efficiencies in the use of energy resources;

  * (8) develop and recommend policies on the import and export of energy resources;

  * (9) collect, evaluate, assemble, and analyze energy information on reserves, production, demand, and related economic data;

  * (10) work with business, labor, consumer and other interests and obtain their cooperation;

  * (11) in administering any pricing authority, provide by rule, for equitable allocation of all component costs of producing propane gas. Such rules may require that (a) only those costs directly related to the production of propane may be allocated by any producer to such gas for purposes of establishing any price for propane, and (b) prices for propane shall be based on the prices for propane in effect on May 15, 1973. The Administrator shall not allow costs attributable to changes in ownership and movement of propane gas where, in the opinion of the Administrator, such changes in ownership and movement occur primarily for the purpose of establishing a higher price; and

  * (12) perform such other functions as may be prescribed by law.

#### (c) Exercise of delegated discretion concerning exemptions
* (1) The Administrator shall not exercise the discretion delegated to him by the President, pursuant to section 754(b) of this title, to submit to the Congress as one energy action any amendment to the regulation under section 753(a) of this title, pursuant to section 760a of this title, which amendment exempts any oil, refined petroleum product, or refined product category from both the allocation and pricing provisions of the regulation under section 753 of this title.

* (2) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Administrator from concurrently submitting an energy action relating to price together with an energy action relating to allocation of the same oil, refined petroleum product, or refined product category.

### §765. Transfer of functions
#### (a) Functions of Secretary and Department of the Interior

Such comments shall be published together with publication of notice of the proposed action.

  * (2) The review required by paragraph (1) of this subsection may be waived for a period of fourteen days if there is an emergency situation which, in the judgment of the Administrator, requires making effective the action proposed to be taken at a date earlier than would permit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency the five working days opportunity for prior comment required by paragraph (1). Notice of any such waiver shall be given to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and filed with the Federal Register with the publication of notice of proposed or final agency action and shall include an explanation of the reasons for such waiver, together with supporting data and a description of the factual situation in such detail as the Administrator determines will apprise such agency and the public of the reasons for such waiver.

If any person is aggrieved or adversely affected by a denial of a request for adjustment under the preceding sentences, he may request a review of such denial by the agency and may obtain judicial review in accordance with subsection (c) when such a denial becomes final. The agency shall, by rule, establish appropriate procedures, including a hearing when requested, for review of a denial, and where deemed advisable by the agency, for considering other requests for action under this paragraph, except that no review of a denial under this subparagraph shall be controlled by the same officer denying the adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph.
