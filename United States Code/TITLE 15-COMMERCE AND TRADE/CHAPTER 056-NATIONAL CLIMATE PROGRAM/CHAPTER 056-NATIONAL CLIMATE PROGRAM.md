### **CHAPTER 56—NATIONAL CLIMATE PROGRAM**

### §2901. Findings
* The Congress finds and declares the following:

  * (1) Weather and climate change affect food production, energy use, land use, water resources and other factors vital to national security and human welfare.

  * (2) An ability to anticipate natural and man-induced changes in climate would contribute to the soundness of policy decisions in the public and private sectors.

  * (3) Significant improvements in the ability to forecast climate on an intermediate and long-term basis are possible.

  * (4) Information regarding climate is not being fully disseminated or used, and Federal efforts have given insufficient attention to assessing and applying this information.

  * (5) Climate fluctuation and change occur on a global basis, and deficiencies exist in the system for monitoring global climate changes. International cooperation for the purpose of sharing the benefits and costs of a global effort to understand climate is essential.

  * (6) The United States lacks a well-defined and coordinated program in climate-related research, monitoring, assessment of effects, and information utilization.

### §2902. Purpose
* It is the purpose of the Congress in this chapter to establish a national climate program that will assist the Nation and the world to understand and respond to natural and man-induced climate processes and their implications.

### §2903. Definitions
* As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

  * (1) The term "Board" means the Climate Program Policy Board.

  * (2) The term "Office" means the National Climate Program Office.

  * (3) The term "Program" means the National Climate Program.

  * (4) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Commerce.
