### **CHAPTER 37—STATE TECHNICAL SERVICES**

### §1351. Declaration of purpose
* Congress finds that wider diffusion and more effective application of science and technology in business, commerce, and industry are essential to the growth of the economy, to higher levels of employment, and to the competitive position of United States products in world markets. The Congress also finds that the benefits of federally financed research, as well as other research, must be placed more effectively in the hands of American business, commerce, and industrial establishments. The Congress further finds that the several States through cooperation with universities, communities, and industries can contribute significantly to these purposes by providing technical services designed to encourage a more effective application of science and technology to both new and established business, commerce, and industrial establishments. The Congress, therefore, declares that the purpose of this chapter is to provide a national program of incentives and support for the several States individually and in cooperation with each other in their establishing and maintaining State and interstate technical service programs designed to achieve these ends.

### §1352. Definitions
* For the purposes of this chapter—

* (a) "Technical services" means activities or programs designed to enable businesses, commerce, and industrial establishments to acquire and use scientific and engineering information more effectively through such means as—

  * (1) preparing and disseminating technical reports, abstracts, computer tapes, microfilm, reviews, and similar scientific or engineering information, including the establishment of State or interstate technical information centers for this purpose;

  * (2) providing a reference service to identify sources of engineering and other scientific expertise; and

  * (3) sponsoring industrial workshops, seminars, training programs, extension courses, demonstrations, and field visits designed to encourage the more effective application of scientific and engineering information.


* (b) "Designated agency" means the institution or agency which has been designated as administrator of the program for any State or States under section 1353 or 1357 of this title.

* (c) "Qualified institution" means (1) an institution of higher learning with a program leading to a degree in science, engineering, or business administration which is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association to be listed by the Secretary of Education, or such an institution which is listed separately after evaluation by the Secretary of Education pursuant to this subsection; or (2) a State agency or a private, nonprofit institution which meets criteria of competence established by the Secretary of Commerce and published in the Federal Register. For the purpose of this subsection the Secretary of Education shall publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations which he determines to be reliable authority as to the quality of science, engineering, or business education or training offered. When the Secretary of Education determines that there is no nationally recognized accrediting agency or association qualified to accredit such programs he shall publish a list of institutions he finds qualified after prior evaluation by an advisory committee, composed of persons he determines to be specially qualified to evaluate the training provided under such programs.

* (d) "Participating institution" means each qualified institution in a State, which participates in the administration or execution of the State technical services program as provided by this chapter.

* (e) "Secretary" means the Secretary of Commerce.

* (f) "State" means one of the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam or the Virgin Islands.

* (g) "Governor", in the case of the District of Columbia, means the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

### §1353. Selection of designated agency
* The Governor of any State which wishes to receive Federal payments under this chapter in support of its existing or planned technical services program shall designate, under appropriate State laws and regulations, an institution or agency to administer and coordinate that program and to prepare and submit a plan and programs to the Secretary of Commerce for approval under this chapter.

  * (b) An annual technical services program which shall (1) identify specific methods, which may include contracts, for accomplishing particular goals and outline the likely impact of these methods in terms of the five-year plan; (2) contain a detailed budget, together with procedures for adequate fiscal control, fund accounting, and auditing, to assure proper disbursement for funds paid to the State under this chapter; and (3) indicate the specific responsibilities assigned to each participating institution in the State.

### §1355. Conditions precedent to acceptance of plans and programs for review and approval by Secretary
