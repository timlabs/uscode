#### (c) Co-chairs
* The Interagency working group shall be co-chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and, on a biannual rotating basis, a representative from a member agency, as selected by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

#### (d) Responsibilities of the working group
* The interagency working group established under subsection (a) shall—

  * (1) provide for interagency coordination of federally funded PFAS research and development; and

  * (2) not later than 12 months after January 1, 2021, develop and make publicly available a strategic plan for Federal support for PFAS research and development (to be updated not less frequently than once every three years) that—

    * (A) identifies all current federally funded PFAS research and development, including the nature and scope of such research and development and the amount of funding associated with such research and development during the current fiscal year, disaggregated by agency;

    * (B) identifies all federally funded PFAS research and development having taken place in the last three years, excluding the research listed under subparagraph (A), including the nature and scope of such research and development and the amount of funding associated with such research and development during the current fiscal year, disaggregated by agency;

    * (C) identifies scientific and technological challenges that must be addressed to understand and to significantly reduce the environmental and human health impacts of PFAS and to identify cost-effective—

      * (i) alternatives to PFAS that are designed to be safer and more environmentally friendly;

      * (ii) methods for removal of PFAS from the environment; and

      * (iii) methods to safely destroy or degrade PFAS;
