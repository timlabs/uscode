### **CHAPTER 87—TELEMARKETING AND CONSUMER FRAUD AND ABUSE PREVENTION**

### §6101. Findings
* The Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) Telemarketing differs from other sales activities in that it can be carried out by sellers across State lines without direct contact with the consumer. Telemarketers also can be very mobile, easily moving from State to State.

  * (2) Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of such magnitude that the resources of the Federal Trade Commission are not sufficient to ensure adequate consumer protection from such fraud.

  * (3) Consumers and others are estimated to lose $40 billion a year in telemarketing fraud.

  * (4) Consumers are victimized by other forms of telemarketing deception and abuse.

  * (5) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that will offer consumers necessary protection from telemarketing deception and abuse.

### §6102. Telemarketing rules
#### (a) In general
* (1) The Commission shall prescribe rules prohibiting deceptive telemarketing acts or practices and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices.

* (2) The Commission shall include in such rules respecting deceptive telemarketing acts or practices a definition of deceptive telemarketing acts or practices which shall include fraudulent charitable solicitations, and which may include acts or practices of entities or individuals that assist or facilitate deceptive telemarketing, including credit card laundering.

* (3) The Commission shall include in such rules respecting other abusive telemarketing acts or practices—

  * (A) a requirement that telemarketers may not undertake a pattern of unsolicited telephone calls which the reasonable consumer would consider coercive or abusive of such consumer's right to privacy,

  * (B) restrictions on the hours of the day and night when unsolicited telephone calls can be made to consumers,

  * (C) a requirement that any person engaged in telemarketing for the sale of goods or services shall promptly and clearly disclose to the person receiving the call that the purpose of the call is to sell goods or services and make such other disclosures as the Commission deems appropriate, including the nature and price of the goods and services; and

  * (D) a requirement that any person engaged in telemarketing for the solicitation of charitable contributions, donations, or gifts of money or any other thing of value, shall promptly and clearly disclose to the person receiving the call that the purpose of the call is to solicit charitable contributions, donations, or gifts, and make such other disclosures as the Commission considers appropriate, including the name and mailing address of the charitable organization on behalf of which the solicitation is made.


* In prescribing the rules described in this paragraph, the Commission shall also consider recordkeeping requirements.

#### (b) Rulemaking authority
* The Commission shall have authority to prescribe rules under subsection (a), in accordance with section 553 of title 5. In prescribing a rule under this section that relates to the provision of a consumer financial product or service that is subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, including any enumerated consumer law thereunder, the Commission shall consult with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection regarding the consistency of a proposed rule with standards, purposes, or objectives administered by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

#### (c) Violations
* Any violation of any rule prescribed under subsection (a)—

  * (1) shall be treated as a violation of a rule under section 57a of this title regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices; and

  * (2) that is committed by a person subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 shall be treated as a violation of a rule under section 1031 of that Act [12 U.S.C. 5531] regarding unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.

  * #### (B) Exception

      * (i) Federal securities laws or rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder provide protection from deceptive and other abusive telemarketing by persons described in paragraph (2) substantially similar to that provided by rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission under subsection (a); or

      * (ii) such a rule promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest, or for the protection of investors, or would be inconsistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.
