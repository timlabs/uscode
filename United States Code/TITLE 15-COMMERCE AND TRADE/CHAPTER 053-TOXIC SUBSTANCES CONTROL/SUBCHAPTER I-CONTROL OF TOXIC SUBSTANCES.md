### SUBCHAPTER I—CONTROL OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES

### §2601. Findings, policy, and intent
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) human beings and the environment are being exposed each year to a large number of chemical substances and mixtures;

  * (2) among the many chemical substances and mixtures which are constantly being developed and produced, there are some whose manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment; and

  * (3) the effective regulation of interstate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures also necessitates the regulation of intrastate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures.

#### (b) Policy
* It is the policy of the United States that—

  * (1) adequate information should be developed with respect to the effect of chemical substances and mixtures on health and the environment and that the development of such information should be the responsibility of those who manufacture and those who process such chemical substances and mixtures;

  * (2) adequate authority should exist to regulate chemical substances and mixtures which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and to take action with respect to chemical substances and mixtures which are imminent hazards; and

  * (3) authority over chemical substances and mixtures should be exercised in such a manner as not to impede unduly or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation while fulfilling the primary purpose of this chapter to assure that such innovation and commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures do not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

#### (c) Intent of Congress
* It is the intent of Congress that the Administrator shall carry out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner, and that the Administrator shall consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action the Administrator takes or proposes as provided under this chapter.

### §2603. Testing of chemical substances and mixtures
#### (a) Testing requirements
* (1) If the Administrator finds that—

  * (A)(i)(I) the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,

  * (II) there is insufficient information and experience upon which the effects of such manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and

  * (III) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such information; or

  * (ii)(I) a chemical substance or mixture is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and (aa) it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or (bb) there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to such substance or mixture,

  * (II) there is insufficient information and experience upon which the effects of the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and

  * (III) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such information; and

  * (B) in the case of a mixture, the effects which the mixture's manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal or any combination of such activities may have on health or the environment may not be reasonably and more efficiently determined or predicted by testing the chemical substances which comprise the mixture;


* the Administrator shall by rule, or, in the case of a chemical substance or mixture described in subparagraph (A)(i), by rule, order, or consent agreement, require that testing be conducted on such substance or mixture to develop information with respect to the health and environmental effects for which there is an insufficiency of information and experience and which is relevant to a determination that the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

* (2) ADDITIONAL TESTING AUTHORITY.—In addition to the authority provided under paragraph (1), the Administrator may, by rule, order, or consent agreement—

  * (A) require the development of new information relating to a chemical substance or mixture if the Administrator determines that the information is necessary—

    * (i) to review a notice under section 2604 of this title or to perform a risk evaluation under section 2605(b) of this title;

    * (ii) to implement a requirement imposed in a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (e) or (f) of section 2604 of this title or in a rule promulgated under section 2605(a) of this title;

    * (iii) at the request of a Federal implementing authority under another Federal law, to meet the regulatory testing needs of that authority with regard to toxicity and exposure; or

    * (iv) pursuant to section 2611(a)(2) of this title; and


  * (B) require the development of new information for the purposes of prioritizing a chemical substance under section 2605(b) of this title only if the Administrator determines that such information is necessary to establish the priority of the substance, subject to the limitations that—

    * (i) not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of information regarding a chemical substance complying with a rule, order, or consent agreement under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall designate the chemical substance as a high-priority substance or a low-priority substance; and

    * (ii) information required by the Administrator under this subparagraph shall not be required for the purposes of establishing or implementing a minimum information requirement of broader applicability.


* (3) STATEMENT OF NEED.—When requiring the development of new information relating to a chemical substance or mixture under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall identify the need for the new information, describe how information reasonably available to the Administrator was used to inform the decision to require new information, explain the basis for any decision that requires the use of vertebrate animals, and, as applicable, explain why issuance of an order is warranted instead of promulgating a rule or entering into a consent agreement.

* (4) TIERED TESTING.—When requiring the development of new information under this subsection, the Administrator shall employ a tiered screening and testing process, under which the results of screening-level tests or assessments of available information inform the decision as to whether 1 or more additional tests are necessary, unless information available to the Administrator justifies more advanced testing of potential health or environmental effects or potential exposure without first conducting screening-level testing.

#### (b) Testing requirement rule, order, or consent agreement
* (1) A rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) shall include—

  * (A) identification of the chemical substance or mixture for which testing is required under the rule, order, or consent agreement,

  * (B) protocols and methodologies for the development of information for such substance or mixture, and

  * (C) with respect to chemical substances which are not new chemical substances and to mixtures, a specification of the period (which period may not be of unreasonable duration) within which the persons required to conduct the testing shall submit to the Administrator information developed in accordance with the protocols and methodologies referred to in subparagraph (B).


* In determining the protocols and methodologies and period to be included, pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), the Administrator's considerations shall include the relative costs of the various test protocols and methodologies which may be required under the rule, order, or consent agreement and the reasonably foreseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testing required under the rule, order, or consent agreement. Any such rule, order, or consent agreement may require the submission to the Administrator of preliminary information during the period prescribed under subparagraph (C).

* (2)(A) The health and environmental effects for which protocols and methodologies for the development of information may be prescribed include carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, teratogenesis, behavioral disorders, cumulative or synergistic effects, and any other effect which may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Protocols and methodologies for the development of information may also be prescribed for the assessment of exposure or exposure potential to humans or the environment. The characteristics of chemical substances and mixtures for which such protocols and methodologies may be prescribed include persistence, acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and any other characteristic which may present such a risk. The methodologies that may be prescribed in such protocols and methodologies include epidemiologic studies, serial or tiered testing, in vitro tests, and whole animal tests, except that before prescribing epidemiologic studies of employees, the Administrator shall consult with the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

* (B) From time to time, but not less than once each 12 months, the Administrator shall review the adequacy of the protocols and methodologies for development of information prescribed in rules, orders, and consent agreements under subsection (a) and shall, if necessary, institute proceedings to make appropriate revisions of such protocols and methodologies.

* (3)(A) A rule or order under subsection (a) respecting a chemical substance or mixture shall require the persons described in subparagraph (B) or (C), as applicable, to conduct tests and submit information to the Administrator on such substance or mixture, except that the Administrator may permit two or more of such persons to designate one such person or a qualified third party to conduct such tests and submit such information on behalf of the persons making the designation.

* (B) The following persons shall be required to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture subject to a rule under subsection (a)(1):

  * (i) Each person who manufactures or intends to manufacture such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the manufacture of such substance or mixture.

  * (ii) Each person who processes or intends to process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the processing of such substance or mixture.

  * (iii) Each person who manufactures or processes or intends to manufacture or process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture.


* (C) A rule or order under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) may require the development of information by any person who manufactures or processes, or intends to manufacture or process, a chemical substance or mixture subject to the rule or order.

* (4) Any rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) requiring the testing of and submission of information for a particular chemical substance or mixture shall expire at the end of the reimbursement period (as defined in subsection (c)(3)(B)) which is applicable to information for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator repeals the rule or order or modifies the consent agreement to terminate the requirement before such date; and a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) requiring the testing of and submission of information for a category of chemical substances or mixtures shall expire with respect to a chemical substance or mixture included in the category at the end of the reimbursement period (as so defined) which is applicable to information for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator before such date repeals or modifies the application of the rule, order, or consent agreement to such substance or mixture or repeals the rule or order or modifies the consent agreement to terminate the requirement.

#### (c) Exemption
* (1) Any person required by a rule or order under subsection (a) to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture may apply to the Administrator (in such form and manner as the Administrator shall prescribe) for an exemption from such requirement.

* (2) If, upon receipt of an application under paragraph (1), the Administrator determines that—

  * (A) the chemical substance or mixture with respect to which such application was submitted is equivalent to a chemical substance or mixture for which information has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) or for which information is being developed pursuant to such a rule, order, or consent agreement, and

  * (B) submission of information by the applicant on such substance or mixture would be duplicative of information which has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with such rule, order, or consent agreement or which is being developed pursuant to such rule, order, or consent agreement,


* the Administrator shall exempt, in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4), the applicant from conducting tests and submitting information on such substance or mixture under the rule or order with respect to which such application was submitted.

* (3)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the existence of previously submitted information and if such exemption is granted during the reimbursement period for such information (as prescribed by subparagraph (B)), then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—

  * (i) to the person who previously submitted such information, for a portion of the costs incurred by such person in complying with the requirement to submit such information, and

  * (ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to such costs, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.

    * (I) five years after the date referred to in clause (i), or

    * (II) at the expiration of a period which begins on the date referred to in clause (i) and which is equal to the period which the Administrator determines was necessary to develop such information,


* whichever is later.


* (4)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the fact that information is being developed by one or more persons pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—

  * (i) to each such person who is developing such information, for a portion of the costs incurred by each such person in complying with such rule, order, or consent agreement, and

  * (ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to the costs of complying with such rule, order, or consent agreement, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.


* In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider the factors described in the second sentence of paragraph (3)(A). An order under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.

* (B) If any exemption is granted under paragraph (2) on the basis of the fact that one or more persons are developing information pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) and if after such exemption is granted the Administrator determines that no such person has complied with such rule, order, or consent agreement, the Administrator shall (i) after providing written notice to the person who holds such exemption and an opportunity for a hearing, by order terminate such exemption, and (ii) notify in writing such person of the requirements of the rule or order with respect to which such exemption was granted.

#### (d) Notice
* Upon the receipt of any information pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), the Administrator shall publish a notice of the receipt of such information in the Federal Register within 15 days of its receipt. Subject to section 2613 of this title, each such notice shall (1) identify the chemical substance or mixture for which information has been received; (2) list the uses or intended uses of such substance or mixture and the information required by the applicable protocols and methodologies for the development of information; and (3) describe the nature of the information developed.

Such report shall also request such agency—

  * (A)(i) to determine if the risk described in such report may be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken under such law, and

  * (ii) if the agency determines that such risk may be so prevented or reduced, to issue an order declaring whether or not the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of such risk presents such risk; and

  * (B) to respond to the Administrator with respect to the matters described in subparagraph (A).


* Any report of the Administrator shall include a detailed statement of the information on which it is based and shall be published in the Federal Register. The agency receiving a request under such a report shall make the requested determination, issue the requested order, and make the requested response within such time as the Administrator specifies in the request, but such time specified may not be less than 90 days from the date the request was made. The response of an agency shall be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the agency and shall be published in the Federal Register.

* (2) If the Administrator makes a report under paragraph (1) with respect to a chemical substance or mixture and the agency to which such report was made either—

  * (A) issues an order, within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report, declaring that the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of the risk described in the report does not present the risk described in the report, or

  * (B) responds within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report and initiates, within 90 days of the publication in the Federal Register of the response of the agency under paragraph (1), action under the law (or laws) administered by such agency to protect against such risk associated with such activity or combination of activities,


* the Administrator may not take any action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title with respect to such risk.

* (3) The Administrator shall take the actions described in paragraph (4) if the Administrator makes a report under paragraph (1) with respect to a chemical substance or mixture and the agency to which the report was made does not—

  * (A) issue the order described in paragraph (2)(A) within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report; or

  * (B)(i) respond under paragraph (1) within the timeframe specified by the Administrator in the report; and

  * (ii) initiate action within 90 days of publication in the Federal Register of the response described in clause (i).


* (4) If an agency to which a report is submitted under paragraph (1) does not take the actions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (3), the Administrator shall—

  * (A) initiate or complete appropriate action under section 2605(a) of this title; or

  * (B) take any action authorized or required under section 2606 of this title, as applicable.


* (5) This subsection shall not relieve the Administrator of any obligation to take any appropriate action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title to address risks from the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or any combination of those activities, that are not identified in a report issued by the Administrator under paragraph (1).

* (6) If the Administrator has initiated action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title with respect to a risk associated with a chemical substance or mixture which was the subject of a report made to an agency under paragraph (1), such agency shall before taking action under the law (or laws) administered by it to protect against such risk consult with the Administrator for the purpose of avoiding duplication of Federal action against such risk.

#### (b) Laws administered by the Administrator
* (1) The Administrator shall coordinate actions taken under this chapter with actions taken under other Federal laws administered in whole or in part by the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that a risk to health or the environment associated with a chemical substance or mixture could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under the authorities contained in such other Federal laws, the Administrator shall use such authorities to protect against such risk unless the Administrator determines, in the Administrator's discretion, that it is in the public interest to protect against such risk by actions taken under this chapter. This subsection shall not be construed to relieve the Administrator of any requirement imposed on the Administrator by such other Federal laws.

* (2) In making a determination under paragraph (1) that it is in the public interest for the Administrator to take an action under this subchapter with respect to a chemical substance or mixture rather than under another law administered in whole or in part by the Administrator, the Administrator shall consider, based on information reasonably available to the Administrator, all relevant aspects of the risk described in paragraph (1) and a comparison of the estimated costs and efficiencies of the action to be taken under this subchapter and an action to be taken under such other law to protect against such risk.

#### (b) Procedures
* (1) Such petition shall be filed in the principal office of the Administrator and shall set forth the facts which it is claimed establish that it is necessary to issue, amend, or repeal a rule under section 2603, 2605, or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) or (f) of this title.

* (3) Within 90 days after filing of a petition described in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall either grant or deny the petition. If the Administrator grants such petition, the Administrator shall promptly commence an appropriate proceeding in accordance with section 2603, 2604, 2605, or 2607 of this title. If the Administrator denies such petition, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the Administrator's reasons for such denial.

* (4)(A) If the Administrator denies a petition filed under this section (or if the Administrator fails to grant or deny such petition within the 90-day period) the petitioner may commence a civil action in a district court of the United States to compel the Administrator to initiate a rulemaking proceeding as requested in the petition. Any such action shall be filed within 60 days after the Administrator's denial of the petition or, if the Administrator fails to grant or deny the petition within 90 days after filing the petition, within 60 days after the expiration of the 90-day period.

* (B) In an action under subparagraph (A) respecting a petition to initiate a proceeding to issue a rule under section 2603, 2605, or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) or (f) of this title, the petitioner shall be provided an opportunity to have such petition considered by the court in a de novo proceeding.

  * (i) in the case of a petition to initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under section 2603 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) of this title—

    * (I) information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the chemical substance to be subject to such rule or order; and

    * (II) in the absence of such information, the substance may present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment, or the substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities and it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to it; or


  * (ii) in the case of a petition to initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under section 2605(a) or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2604(f) of this title, the chemical substance or mixture to be subject to such rule or order presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, under the conditions of use.


* the court shall order the Administrator to initiate the action requested by the petitioner. If the court finds that the extent of the risk to health or the environment alleged by the petitioner is less than the extent of risks to health or the environment with respect to which the Administrator is taking action under this chapter and there are insufficient resources available to the Administrator to take the action requested by the petitioner, the court may permit the Administrator to defer initiating the action requested by the petitioner until such time as the court prescribes.
