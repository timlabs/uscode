### **CHAPTER 85—ARMORED CAR INDUSTRY RECIPROCITY**

### §5901. Findings
* Congress finds that—

  * (1) the distribution of goods and services to consumers in the United States requires the free flow of currency, bullion, securities, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, and other items of unusual value in interstate commerce;

  * (2) the armored car industry transports and protects such items in interstate commerce, including daily transportation of currency and supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits valued at more than $1,000,000,000;

  * (3) armored car crew members are often subject to armed attack by individuals attempting to steal such items;

  * (4) to protect themselves and the items they transport, such crew members are armed with weapons;

  * (5) various States require both weapons training and a criminal record background check before licensing a crew member to carry a weapon; and

  * (6) there is a need for each State to reciprocally accept weapons licenses of other States for armored car crew members to assure the free and safe transport of valuable items in interstate commerce.

### §5902. State reciprocity of weapons licenses issued to armored car company crew members
#### (a) In general
* If an armored car crew member employed by an armored car company—

  * (1) has in effect a license issued by the appropriate State agency (in the State in which such member is primarily employed by such company) to carry a weapon while acting in the services of such company in that State, and such State agency meets the minimum requirements under subsection (b); and

  * (2) has met all other applicable requirements to act as an armored car crew member in the State in which such member is primarily employed by such company,


* then such crew member shall be entitled to lawfully carry any weapon to which such license relates and function as an armored car crew member in any State while such member is acting in the service of such company.

#### (b) Minimum State requirements
* A State agency meets the minimum State requirements of this subsection if—

    * (A) the crew member has received classroom and range training in weapons safety and marksmanship during the current year from a qualified instructor for each weapon that the crew member will be licensed to carry; and

    * (B) the receipt or possession of a weapon by the crew member would not violate Federal law, determined on the basis of a criminal record background check conducted during the current year;


  * (2) in issuing a renewal of a weapons license to an armored car crew member described in subsection (a), the agency determines to its satisfaction that—

    * (A) the crew member has received continuing training in weapons safety and marksmanship from a qualified instructor for each weapon that the crew member is licensed to carry; and

    * (B) the receipt or possession of a weapon by the crew member would not violate Federal law, as determined by the agency; and


  * (3) in issuing a weapons license under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as the case may be—

    * (A) the agency issues such license for a period not to exceed 2 years; or

    * (B) the agency issues such license for a period not to exceed 5 years in the case of a State that enacted a State law before October 1, 1996, that provides for the issuance of an initial weapons license or a renewal of a weapons license, as the case may be, for a period not to exceed 5 years.
