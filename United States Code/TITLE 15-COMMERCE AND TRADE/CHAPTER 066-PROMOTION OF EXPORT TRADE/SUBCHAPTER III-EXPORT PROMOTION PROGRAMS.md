#### (d) Conventional markets not to be displaced by barters
* The President shall take steps to ensure that, in making any barter described in subsection (a) or (b)(1) or any purchase authorized by subsection (b)(2), existing export markets for agricultural commodities operating on conventional business terms are safeguarded from displacement by the barter described in subsection (a), (b)(1), or (b)(2), as the case may be.
