    * A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be required to notify the counterparty of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant at the beginning of a security-based swap transaction that the counterparty has the right to require segregation of the funds of other property supplied to margin, guarantee, or secure the obligations of the counterparty.

  * #### (B) Segregation and maintenance of funds
    * At the request of a counterparty to a security-based swap that provides funds or other property to a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to margin, guarantee, or secure the obligations of the counterparty, the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall—

      * (i) segregate the funds or other property for the benefit of the counterparty; and

      * (ii) in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may promulgate, maintain the funds or other property in a segregated account separate from the assets and other interests of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.

#### (g) Bankruptcy
* A security-based swap, as defined in section 78c(a)(68) of this title shall be considered to be a security as such term is used in section 101(53A)(B) and subchapter III of title 11. An account that holds a security-based swap, other than a portfolio margining account referred to in section 78o(c)(3)(C) of this title shall be considered to be a securities account, as that term is defined in section 741 of title 11. The definitions of the terms "purchase" and "sale" in section 78c(a)(13) and (14) of this title shall be applied to the terms "purchase" and "sale", as used in section 741 of title 11. The term "customer", as defined in section 741 of title 11, excludes any person, to the extent that such person has a claim based on any open repurchase agreement, open reverse repurchase agreement, stock borrowed agreement, non-cleared option, or non-cleared security-based swap except to the extent of any margin delivered to or by the customer with respect to which there is a customer protection requirement under section 78o(c)(3) of this title or a segregation requirement.
