### §636d. Disaster aid to major sources of employment
#### (a) Loans to disaster areas
* The Small Business Administration in the case of a nonagricultural enterprise, and the Farmers Home Administration in the case of an agricultural enterprise, are authorized to provide any industrial, commercial, agricultural, or other enterprise, which has constituted a major source of employment in an area suffering a major disaster and which is no longer in substantial operation as a result of such disaster, a loan in such amount as may be necessary to enable such enterprise to resume operations in order to assist in restoring the economic viability of the disaster area. Loans authorized by this section shall be made without regard to limitations on the size of loans which may otherwise be imposed by any other provision of law or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.

#### (b) Interest; deferred payments
* Assistance under this section shall be in addition to any other Federal disaster assistance, except that such other assistance may be adjusted or modified to the extent deemed appropriate by the Director under the authority of section 4418 of title 42. Any loan made under this section shall be subject to the interest requirements of section 636b of this title, but the President, if he deems it necessary, may defer payments of principal and interest for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the loan. Any such deferred payments shall bear interest at the rate determined under section 636b of this title.
