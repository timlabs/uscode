The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Administrator deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein acquired by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be exercised by the Administrator or by any officer or agent appointed by him without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Administrator from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer or agent he may appoint;

  * (5) acquire, in any lawful manner, any property (real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), whenever deemed necessary or appropriate to the conduct of the activities authorized in sections 636(a) and 636(b) of this title;

  * (6) make such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the authority vested in him by or pursuant to this chapter;

  * (7) in addition to any powers, functions, privileges and immunities otherwise vested in him, take any and all actions (including the procurement of the services of attorneys by contract in any office where an attorney or attorneys are not or cannot be economically employed full time to render such services) when he determines such actions are necessary or desirable in making, servicing, compromising, modifying, liquidating, or otherwise dealing with or realizing on loans made under the provisions of this chapter: _Provided_, That with respect to deferred participation loans, including loans guaranteed under paragraph (15) or (35) of section 636(a) of this title, the Administrator may, in the discretion of and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Administrator, authorize participating lending institutions to take actions relating to loan servicing on behalf of the Administrator, including determining eligibility and creditworthiness and loan monitoring, collection, and liquidation;

  * (9) accept the services and facilities of Federal, State, and local agencies and groups, both public and private, and utilize such gratuitous services and facilities as may, from time to time, be necessary, to further the objectives of section 636(b) of this title;

  * (10) upon purchase by the Administration of any deferred participation entered into under section 636 of this title, continue to charge a rate of interest not to exceed that initially charged by the participating institution on the amount so purchased for the remaining term of the indebtedness;

  * (11) make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether a recipient of or participant in any assistance under this chapter or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a recipient or participant, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found;

  * (12) impose, retain, and use only those fees which are specifically authorized by law or which are in effect on September 30, 1994, and in the amounts and at the rates in effect on such date, except that the Administrator may, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, impose, retain, and utilize, additional fees—

  * (14) require any lender authorized to make loans under section 636 of this title to pay examination and review fees, which shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and shall be available for the costs of examinations, reviews, and other lender oversight activities.

* To such extent as he finds necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to procure the temporary (not in excess of one year) or intermittent services of experts or consultants or organizations thereof, including stenographic reporting services, by contract or appointment, and in such cases such services shall be without regard to the civil-service and classification laws and, except in the case of stenographic reporting services by organizations, without regard to section 6101 of title 41.

#### (e) Undertaking or suspension of payment obligation; period; extension of maturity; repayment agreement; "required payments" defined
* (1) Subject to the requirements and conditions contained in this subsection, upon application by a small business concern which is the recipient of a loan made under this chapter, the Administration may undertake the small business concern's obligation to make the required payments under such loan or may suspend such obligation if the loan was a direct loan made by the Administration. While such payments are being made by the Administration pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the small business concern.

* (2) The Administration may undertake or suspend for a period of not to exceed 5 years any small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if—

  * (A) without such undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become insolvent or remain insolvent;

  * (i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period, or

  * (ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Administration and the small business concern, or

  * (iii) by a combination of the payments described in clause (i) and clause (ii).


* (B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A), the Administration shall, prior to the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action, and require the small business concern to take such action as the Administration deems appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Administration deems necessary or appropriate to insure that the rights and interests of the lender (Small Business Administration or participant) will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.

* (5) The term "required payments" with respect to any loan means payments of principal and interest under the loan.

#### (f) Sale of guaranteed portion of loans by lender or subsequent holder; limitations; secondary market
* (1) The guaranteed portion of any loan made pursuant to this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, consistent with regulations on such sales as the Administration shall establish, subject to the following limitations:

  * (A) prior to the Administration's approval of the sale, or upon any subsequent resale, of any loan guaranteed by the Administration, if the lender certifies that such loan has been properly closed and that the lender has substantially complied with the provisions of the guarantee agreement and the regulations of the Administration, the Administration shall review and approve only materials not previously approved;

  * (B) all fees due the Administration on a guaranteed loan shall have been paid in full prior to any sale; and

  * (C) each loan, except each loan made under section 636(a)(14) of this title, shall have been fully disbursed to the borrower prior to any sale.

* (3) The Administration shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for assessing the increase of small business access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations. Beginning on March 31, 1997, the sale of the unguaranteed portion of any loan made under section 636(a) of this title shall not be permitted until a final regulation that applies uniformly to both depository institutions and other lenders is promulgated by the Administration setting forth the terms and conditions under which such sales can be permitted, including maintenance of appropriate reserve requirements and other safeguards to protect the safety and soundness of the program.

* (4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to section 636(a) of this title, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title or subsection (e) of this section.

* (2) The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.

* (3) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent pursuant to this subsection.

* (4)(A) The Administration may collect a fee for any loan guarantee sold into the secondary market under subsection (f) in an amount equal to not more than 50 percent of the portion of the sale price that exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan guaranteed by the Administration. Any such fee imposed by the Administration shall be collected by the Administration or by the agent which carries out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions required by subsection (h) of this section and shall be paid to the Administration and used solely to reduce the subsidy on loans guaranteed under section 636(a) of this title: _Provided_, That such fee shall not be charged to the borrower whose loan is guaranteed: and, _Provided further_, That nothing herein shall preclude any agent of the Administration from collecting a fee approved by the Administration for the functions described in subsection (h)(2).

* (B) The Administration is authorized to impose and collect, either directly or through a fiscal and transfer agent, a reasonable penalty on late payments of the fee authorized under subparagraph (A) in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of such fee per month plus interest.

* (C) The Administration may contract with an agent to carry out, on behalf of the Administration, the assessment and collection of the annual fee established under section 636(a)(23) of this title. The agent may receive, as compensation for services, any interest earned on the fee while in the control of the agent before the time at which the agent is contractually required to remit the fee to the Administration.

* (5)(A) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.

* (B) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.

* (6) If the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under section 636(a) of this title is more than $500,000, the Administrator shall, upon request of a pool assembler, divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000. Only 1 increment of any loan guarantee divided under this paragraph may be included in the same pool.

  * (C) prior to any sale, require the seller to disclose to a purchaser of the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to the purchaser of a trust certificate issued pursuant to subsection (g), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this paragraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term "seller" does not include (A) an entity which made the loan or (B) any individual or entity which sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year; and

  * (D) have the authority to regulate brokers and dealers in guaranteed loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
