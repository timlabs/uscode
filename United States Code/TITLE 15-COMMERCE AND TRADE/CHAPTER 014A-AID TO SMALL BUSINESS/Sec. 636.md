Such financings may be made either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis. These powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions, limitations, and provisions:

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—

    * (A) CREDIT ELSEWHERE.—

      * (ii) LIQUIDITY.—On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the interest rate on the Administration's share of any loan made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection to repair or replace a primary residence and/or replace or repair damaged or destroyed personal property, less the amount of compensation by insurance or otherwise, with respect to a disaster occurring on or after July 1, 1976, and prior to October 1, 1978, shall be: 1 per centum on the amount of such loan not exceeding $10,000, and 3 per centum on the amount of such loan over $10,000 but not exceeding $40,000.

All repayments of principal on the Administration's share of any loan made under the above provisions shall first be applied to reduce the principal sum of such loan which bears interest at the lower rates provided in this paragraph. The principal amount of any loan made pursuant to paragraph (1) in connection with a disaster which occurs on or after April 1, 1977, but prior to January 1, 1978, may be increased by such amount, but not more than $2,000, as the Administration determines to be reasonable in light of the amount and nature of loss, damage, or injury sustained in order to finance the installation of insulation in the property which was lost, damaged, or injured, if the uninsured, damaged portion of the property is 10 per centum or more of the market value of the property at the time of the disaster. Not later than June 1, 1978, the Administration shall prepare and transmit to the Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate, the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, and the Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives having jurisdiction over measures relating to energy conservation, a report on its activities under this paragraph, including therein an evaluation of the effect of such activities on encouraging the installation of insulation in property which is repaired or replaced after a disaster which is subject to this paragraph, and its recommendations with respect to the continuation, modification, or termination of such activities.

  * (D) shall notwithstanding the provisions of any other law and upon presentation by the applicant of proof of loss or damage or injury and a bona fide estimate of cost of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement, cancel the principal of any loan made to cover a loss or damage or injury resulting from such disaster, except that—

  * (D)(i) Promptly after certification under paragraph (11) a Program Participant shall submit a business plan (hereinafter referred to as the "plan") as described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph for review by the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned to assist such Program Participant. The plan may be a revision of a preliminary business plan submitted by the Program Participant or required by the Administration as a part of the application for certification under this section and shall be designed to result in the Program Participant eliminating the conditions or circumstances upon which the Administration determined eligibility pursuant to section 637(a)(6) of this title.

  * (iii) Each Program Participant shall annually review its currently approved plan with its Business Opportunity Specialist and modify such plan as may be appropriate. Any modified plan shall be submitted to the Administration for approval.

Annual reviews pertaining to years in the transitional stage of program participation shall require, as appropriate, a written verification that such Program Participant has complied with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.

  * (iv) Each Program Participant shall annually forecast its needs for contract awards under section 637(a) of this title for the next program year and the succeeding program year during the review of its business plan, conducted pursuant to clause (iii).

    * (I) the aggregate dollar value of contract support to be sought on a noncompetitive basis under section 637(a) of this title, reflecting compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title,

    * (II) the types of contract opportunities being sought, identified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or otherwise,

  * (E) A small business concern participating in the program conducted under the authority of this paragraph and eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title shall be denied all such assistance if such concern—

    * (i) voluntarily elects not to continue participation;

    * (ii) completes the period of Program participation as prescribed by paragraph (15);

    * (iii) is terminated pursuant to a termination proceeding conducted in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title; or

  * (F) For purposes of this section and section 637(a) of this title, the term "terminated" and the term "termination" means the total denial or suspension of assistance under this paragraph or under section 637(a) of this title prior to the graduation of the participating small business concern or prior to the expiration of the maximum program participation term. An action for termination shall be based upon good cause, including—

    * (i) the failure by such concern to maintain its eligibility for Program participation;

    * (ii) the failure of the concern to engage in business practices that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of unjustified delinquent performance or terminations for default with respect to contracts awarded under the authority of section 637(a) of this title;

    * (iii) a demonstrated pattern of failing to make required submissions or responses to the Administration in a timely manner;

    * (iv) the willful violation of any rule or regulation of the Administration pertaining to material issues;

    * (v) the debarment of the concern or its disadvantaged owners by any agency pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation); or

    * (vi) the conviction of the disadvantaged owner or an officer of the concern for any offense indicating a lack of business integrity including any conviction for embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or violation of section 645 of this title. For purposes of this clause, no termination action shall be taken with respect to a disadvantaged owner solely because of the conviction of an officer of the concern (who is other than a disadvantaged owner) unless such owner conspired with, abetted, or otherwise knowingly acquiesced in the activity or omission that was the basis of such officer's conviction.


  * (G) The Director of the Division may initiate a termination proceeding by recommending such action to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. Whenever the Associate Administrator, or a designee of such officer, determines such termination is appropriate, within 15 days after making such a determination the Program Participant shall be provided a written notice of intent to terminate, specifying the reasons for such action. No Program Participant shall be terminated from the Program pursuant to subparagraph (F) without first being afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title.

  * (H) For the purposes of this subsection and section 637(a) of this title the term "graduated" or "graduation" means that the Program Participant is recognized as successfully completing the program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives, and goals contained in the concern's business plan thereby demonstrating its ability to compete in the marketplace without assistance under this section or section 637(a) of this title.

  * (I)(i) During the developmental stage of its participation in the Program, a Program Participant shall take all reasonable efforts within its control to attain the targets contained in its business plan for contracts awarded other than pursuant to section 637(a) of this title (hereinafter referred to as "business activity targets."). Such efforts shall be made a part of the business plan and shall be sufficient in scope and duration to satisfy the Administration that the Program Participant will engage a reasonable marketing strategy that will maximize its potential to achieve its business activity targets.

  * (ii) During the transitional stage of the Program a Program Participant shall be subject to regulations regarding business activity targets that are promulgated by the Administration pursuant to clause (iii);

  * (iii) The regulations referred to in clause (ii) shall:

    * (I) establish business activity targets applicable to Program Participants during the fifth year and each succeeding year of Program Participation; such targets, for such period of time, shall reflect a reasonably consistent increase in contracts awarded other than pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, expressed as a percentage of total sales; when promulgating business activity targets the Administration may establish modified targets for Program Participants that have participated in the Program for a period of longer than four years on June 1, 1989;

    * (II) require a Program Participant to attain its business activity targets;

    * (III) provide that, before the receipt of any contract to be awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, the Program Participant (if it is in the transitional stage) must certify that it has complied with the regulations promulgated pursuant to subclause (II), or that it is in compliance with such remedial measures as may have been ordered pursuant to regulations issued under subclause (V);

    * (IV) require the Administration to review each Program Participant's performance regarding attainment of business activity targets during periodic reviews of such Participant's business plan; and

    * (V) authorize the Administration to take appropriate remedial measures with respect to a Program Participant that has failed to attain a required business activity target for the purpose of reducing such Participant's dependence on contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; such remedial actions may include, but are not limited to assisting the Program Participant to expand the dollar volume of its competitive business activity or limiting the dollar volume of contracts awarded to the Program Participant pursuant to section 637(a) of this title; except for actions that would constitute a termination, remedial measures taken pursuant to this subclause shall not be reviewable pursuant to section 637(a)(9) of this title.


  * (J)(i) The Administration shall conduct an evaluation of a Program Participant's eligibility for continued participation in the Program whenever it receives specific and credible information alleging that such Program Participant no longer meets the requirements for Program eligibility. Upon making a finding that a Program Participant is no longer eligible, the Administration shall initiate a termination proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (F). A Program Participant's eligibility for award of any contract under the authority of section 637(a) of this title may be suspended pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).

  * (ii)(I) Except as authorized by subclauses (II) or (III), no award shall be made pursuant to section 637(a) of this title to a concern other than a small business concern.

  * (II) In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), each firm's size shall be independently determined without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.

  * (III) Any joint venture established under the authority of section 602(b) of Public Law 100–656, the "Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988", shall be eligible for award of a contract pursuant to section 637(a) of this title.

* (ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), any individual upon whom eligibility is based pursuant to section 637(a)(4) of this title shall be permitted to assert such eligibility for only one small business concern.

* (iii) A socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe may own more than one small business concern eligible for assistance pursuant to paragraph (10) and section 637(a) of this title if—

  * (I) the Indian tribe does not own another firm in the same industry which has been determined to be eligible to receive contracts under this program, and

  * (II) the individuals responsible for the management and daily operations of the concern do not manage more than two Program Participants.


* (C) No concern, previously eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title, shall be subsequently recertified for program participation if its prior participation in the program was concluded for any of the reasons described in paragraph (10)(E).

* (D) A concern eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection shall remain eligible for such contracts if there is a transfer of ownership and control (as defined pursuant to section 637(a)(4) of this title) to individuals who are determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged pursuant to section 637(a) of this title. In the event of such a transfer, the concern, if not terminated or graduated, shall be eligible for a period of continued participation in the program not to exceed the time limitations prescribed in paragraph (15).

* (E) There is established a Division of Program Certification and Eligibility (hereinafter referred to in this paragraph as the "Division") that shall be made part of the Office of Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development.

* (G) An applicant shall not be denied admission into the program established by paragraph (10) due solely to a determination by the Division that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist in the development of such concern unless—

  * (i) the Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or

  * (ii) the purchases of such products or services by the Federal Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other Program Participants providing the same or similar items or services.


* (H) Not later than 90 days after receipt of a completed application for Program certification, the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development shall certify a small business concern as a Program Participant or shall deny such application.

The findings and conclusions of the Director shall be reported to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development by September 30 of each year. Based on such report and such additional data as may be relevant, the Associate Administrator shall, by October 31 of each year, issue policy and program directives applicable to such fiscal year that—

When considering such increase the Administration shall give due consideration to those industrial categories where Federal purchases have been substantial but where the participation rate of such concerns has been limited.


* (12)(A) The Administration shall segment the Capital Ownership Development Program into two stages: a developmental stage; and a transitional stage.
