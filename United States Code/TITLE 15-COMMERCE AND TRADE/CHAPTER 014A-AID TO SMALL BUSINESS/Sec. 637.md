### §637. Additional powers
#### (a) Procurement contracts; subcontracts to disadvantaged small business concerns; performance bonds; contract negotiations; definitions; eligibility; determinations; publication; recruitment; construction subcontracts; annual estimates; Indian tribes
* (1) It shall be the duty of the Administration and it is hereby empowered, whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate—

  * (A) to enter into contracts with the United States Government and any department, agency, or officer thereof having procurement powers obligating the Administration to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to the Government or to perform construction work for the Government. In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer's adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer's adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator's request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator's request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the department or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;

  * (B) to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;

  * (C) to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by section 636(j)(15) of this title, if—

    * (i) the contract will be awarded as a result of an offer (including price) submitted in response to a published solicitation relating to a competition conducted pursuant to subparagraph (D); and

    * (ii) the prospective contract awardee was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation; and


  * (D)(i) A contract opportunity offered for award pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded on the basis of competition restricted to eligible Program Participants if—

    * (I) there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible Program Participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price, and

    * (II) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $7,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.


  * (ii) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, on a nondelegable basis, is authorized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.


* (2) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (e) of section 3131 of title 40, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: _Provided_, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if—

  * (A) the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;

  * (B) the Administration assists, insofar as practicable, a small business receiving the benefits of this paragraph to develop, within a reasonable period of time, such financial and other capability as may be needed to obtain such bonds as the Administration may subsequently require for the successful completion of any program conducted under the authority of this subsection;

  * (C) the Administration finds that such small business is unable to obtain the requisite bond or bonds from a surety and that no surety is willing to issue bond or bonds subject to the guarantee provisions of Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 692 et seq.]; and

  * (D) the small business is determined to be a start-up concern and such concern has not been participating in any program conducted under the authority of this subsection for a period exceeding one year.


* The authority to waive bonds provided in this paragraph (2) may not be exercised after September 30, 1988.

* (3)(A) Any Program Participant selected by the Administration to perform a contract to be let noncompetitively pursuant to this subsection shall, when practicable, participate in any negotiation of the terms and conditions of such contract.

* (B)(i) For purposes of paragraph (1) a "fair market price" shall be determined by the agency offering the procurement requirement to the Administration, in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).

* (ii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.

* (iii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.

* (C) An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair market price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency. The agency's estimate of the current fair market price (and any supporting data furnished to the Administration) shall not be disclosed to any potential offeror (other than the Administration).

* (D) A small business concern selected by the Administration to perform or negotiate a contract to be let pursuant to this subsection may request the Administration to protest the agency's estimate of the fair market price for such contract pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).

* (4)(A) For purposes of this section, the term "socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern" means any small business concern which meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) and—

  * (i) which is at least 51 per centum unconditionally owned by—

    * (I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,

    * (II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), or

    * (III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization, or


  * (ii) in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is unconditionally owned by—

    * (I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,

    * (II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), or

    * (III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization.


* (B) A small business concern meets the requirements of this subparagraph if the management and daily business operations of such small business concern are controlled by one or more—

  * (i) socially and economically disadvantaged individuals described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(I),

  * (ii) members of an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe described in subparagraph (A)(i)(II) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), or

  * (iii) Native Hawaiian organizations described in subparagraph (A)(i)(III) or subparagraph (A)(ii)(III).


* (C) Each Program Participant shall certify, on an annual basis, that it meets the requirements of this paragraph regarding ownership and control.

* (5) Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.

* (6)(A) Economically disadvantaged individuals are those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged. In determining the degree of diminished credit and capital opportunities the Administration shall consider, but not be limited to, the assets and net worth of such socially disadvantaged individual. In determining the economic disadvantage of an Indian tribe, the Administration shall consider, where available, information such as the following: the per capita income of members of the tribe excluding judgment awards, the percentage of the local Indian population below the poverty level, and the tribe's access to capital markets.

* (B) Each Program Participant shall annually submit to the Administration—

  * (i) a personal financial statement for each disadvantaged owner;

  * (ii) a record of all payments made by the Program Participant to each of its disadvantaged owners or to any person or entity affiliated with such owners; and

  * (iii) such other information as the Administration may deem necessary to make the determinations required by this paragraph.


* (C)(i) Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the standards to establish economic disadvantage pursuant to subparagraph (A) have not been met, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners continue to be impaired in their ability to compete in the free enterprise system due to diminished capital and credit opportunities when compared to other concerns in the same business area, which are not socially disadvantaged.

* (ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that a Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners are no longer economically disadvantaged for the purpose of receiving assistance under this subsection, the Program Participant shall be graduated pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title subject to the right to a hearing as provided for under paragraph (9).

* (D)(i) Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the amount of funds or other assets withdrawn from a Program Participant for the personal benefit of its disadvantaged owners or any person or entity affiliated with such owners may have been unduly excessive, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such withdrawal of funds or other assets was detrimental to the achievement of the targets, objectives, and goals contained in such Program Participant's business plan.

* (ii) If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that funds or other assets have been withdrawn to the detriment of the Program Participant's business, the Administration shall—

  * (I) initiate a proceeding to terminate the Program Participant pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(F) of this title, subject to the right to a hearing under paragraph (9); or

  * (II) require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other steps as the Administration may deem necessary to ensure the protection of the concern.


* (E) Whenever the Administration computes personal net worth for any purpose under this paragraph, it shall exclude from such computation—

  * (i) the value of investments that disadvantaged owners have in their concerns, except that such value shall be taken into account under this paragraph when comparing such concerns to other concerns in the same business area that are owned by other than socially disadvantaged persons;

  * (ii) the equity that disadvantaged owners have in their primary personal residences, except that any portion of such equity that is attributable to unduly excessive withdrawals from a Program Participant or a concern applying for program participation shall be taken into account.


* (7)(A) No small business concern shall be deemed eligible for any assistance pursuant to this subsection unless the Administration determines that with contract, financial, technical, and management support the small business concern will be able to perform contracts which may be awarded to such concern under paragraph (1)(C) and has reasonable prospects for success in competing in the private sector.

* (B) Limitations established by the Administration in its regulations and procedures restricting the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection to a limited number of standard industrial classification codes in an approved business plan shall not be applied in a manner that inhibits the logical business progression by a participating small business concern into areas of industrial endeavor where such concern has the potential for success.

* (8) All determinations made pursuant to paragraph (5) with respect to whether a group has been subjected to prejudice or bias shall be made by the Administrator after consultation with the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. All other determinations made pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7) shall be made by the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development under the supervision of, and responsible to, the Administrator.

* (9)(A) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (E), the Administration, prior to taking any action described in subparagraph (B), shall provide the small business concern that is the subject of such action, an opportunity for a hearing on the record, in accordance with chapter 5 of title 5.

* (B) The actions referred to in subparagraph (A) are—

  * (i) denial of program admission based upon a negative determination pursuant to paragraph (4), (5), or (6);

  * (ii) a termination pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(F) of this title;

  * (iii) a graduation pursuant to section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title; and

  * (iv) the denial of a request to issue a waiver pursuant to paragraph (21)(B).


* (C) The Administration's proposed action, in any proceeding conducted under the authority of this paragraph, shall be sustained unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

* (D) A decision rendered pursuant to this paragraph shall be the final decision of the Administration and shall be binding upon the Administration and those within its employ.

* (E) The adjudicator selected to preside over a proceeding conducted under the authority of this paragraph shall decline to accept jurisdiction over any matter that—

  * (i) does not, on its face, allege facts that, if proven to be true, would warrant reversal or modification of the Administration's position;

  * (ii) is untimely filed;

  * (iii) is not filed in accordance with the rules of procedure governing such proceedings; or

  * (iv) has been decided by or is the subject of an adjudication before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters.


* (F) Proceedings conducted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall be completed and a decision rendered, insofar as practicable, within ninety days after a petition for a hearing is filed with the adjudicating office.

* (10) The Administration shall develop and implement an outreach program to inform and recruit small business concerns to apply for eligibility for assistance under this subsection. Such program shall make a sustained and substantial effort to solicit applications for certification from small business concerns located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas and within States having relatively few Program Participants and from small disadvantaged business concerns in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the authority of this subsection.

* (11) To the maximum extent practicable, construction subcontracts awarded by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.

* (12)(A) The Administration shall require each concern eligible to receive subcontracts pursuant to this subsection to annually prepare and submit to the Administration a capability statement. Such statement shall briefly describe such concern's various contract performance capabilities and shall contain the name and telephone number of the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned such concern. The Administration shall separate such statements by those primarily dependent upon local contract support and those primarily requiring a national marketing effort. Statements primarily dependent upon local contract support shall be disseminated to appropriate buying activities in the marketing area of the concern. The remaining statements shall be disseminated to the Directors of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization for the appropriate agencies who shall further distribute such statements to buying activities with such agencies that may purchase the types of items or services described on the capability statements.

* (B) Contracting activities receiving capability statements shall, within 60 days after receipt, contact the relevant Business Opportunity Specialist to indicate the number, type, and approximate dollar value of contract opportunities that such activities may be awarding over the succeeding 12-month period and which may be appropriate to consider for award to those concerns for which it has received capability statements.

* (C) Each executive agency reporting to the Federal Procurement Data System contract actions with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000,000 in fiscal year 1988, or in any succeeding fiscal year, shall prepare a forecast of expected contract opportunities or classes of contract opportunities for the next and succeeding fiscal years that small business concerns, including those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, are capable of performing. Such forecast shall be periodically revised during such year. To the extent such information is available, the agency forecasts shall specify:

  * (i) The approximate number of individual contract opportunities (and the number of opportunities within a class).

  * (ii) The approximate dollar value, or range of dollar values, for each contract opportunity or class of contract opportunities.

  * (iii) The anticipated time (by fiscal year quarter) for the issuance of a procurement request.

  * (iv) The activity responsible for the award and administration of the contract.


* (D) The head of each executive agency subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall within 10 days of completion furnish such forecasts to—

  * (i) the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization established pursuant to section 644(k) of this title for such agency; and

  * (iii) the award of the contract would not result in the Program Participant exceeding the requirements established by section 636(j)(10)(I) of this title.

To facilitate the implementation of such volunteer programs the Administration shall maintain at its headquarters and pay the salaries, benefits, and expenses of a volunteer and professional staff to manage and oversee the program. Any such payments made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, SCORE may solicit cash and in-kind contributions from the private sector to be used to carry out its functions under this chapter, and may use payments made by the Administration pursuant to this subparagraph for such solicitation and the management of the contributions received.
