### PART VIII—APPEALS TO DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL

### Rule 8001. Scope of Part VIII Rules; Definition of "BAP"; Method of Transmission
* (a) GENERAL SCOPE. These Part VIII rules govern the procedure in a United States district court and a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court. They also govern certain procedures on appeal to a United States court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d).

* (b) DEFINITION OF "BAP." "BAP" means a bankruptcy appellate panel established by a circuit's judicial council and authorized to hear appeals from a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158.

* (c) METHOD OF TRANSMITTING DOCUMENTS. A document must be sent electronically under these Part VIII rules, unless it is being sent by or to an individual who is not represented by counsel or the court's governing rules permit or require mailing or other means of delivery.

### Rule 8002. Time for Filing Notice of Appeal
* (a) IN GENERAL.

  * (1) _Fourteen-Day Period_. Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.

  * (2) _Filing Before the Entry of Judgment_. A notice of appeal filed after the bankruptcy court announces a decision or order—but before entry of the judgment, order, or decree—is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.

  * (3) _Multiple Appeals_. If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise allowed by this rule, whichever period ends later.

  * (4) _Mistaken Filing in Another Court_. If a notice of appeal is mistakenly filed in a district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the clerk of that court must state on the notice the date on which it was received and transmit it to the bankruptcy clerk. The notice of appeal is then considered filed in the bankruptcy court on the date so stated.

  * (5) _Entry Defined_.

    * (A) A judgment, order, or decree is entered for purposes of this Rule 8002(a):

      * (i) when it is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a), or

      * (ii) if Rule 7058 applies and Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. requires a separate document, when the judgment, order, or decree is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a) and when the earlier of these events occurs:

        * • the judgment, order, or decree is set out in a separate document; or

        * • 150 days have run from entry of the judgment, order, or decree in the docket under Rule 5003(a).


    * (B) A failure to set out a judgment, order, or decree in a separate document when required by Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment, order, or decree.


* (b) EFFECT OF A MOTION ON THE TIME TO APPEAL.

  * (1) _In General_. If a party files in the bankruptcy court any of the following motions and does so within the time allowed by these rules, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:

    * (A) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 7052, whether or not granting the motion would alter the judgment;

    * (B) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 9023;

    * (C) for a new trial under Rule 9023; or

    * (D) for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed within 14 days after the judgment is entered.


  * (2) _Filing an Appeal Before the Motion is Decided_. If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree—but before it disposes of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—the notice becomes effective when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.

  * (3) _Appealing the Ruling on the Motion_. If a party intends to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree upon the motion—the party must file a notice of appeal or an amended notice of appeal. The notice or amended notice must comply with Rule 8003 or 8004 and be filed within the time prescribed by this rule, measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.

  * (4) _No Additional Fee_. No additional fee is required to file an amended notice of appeal.


* (c) APPEAL BY AN INMATE CONFINED IN AN INSTITUTION.

  * (1) _In General_. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8002(c)(1). If an inmate files a notice of appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:

    * (A) it is accompanied by:

      * (i) a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or

      * (ii) evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or


    * (B) the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies Rule 8002(c)(1)(A)(i).


  * (2) _Multiple Appeals_. If an inmate files under this subdivision the first notice of appeal, the 14-day period provided in subdivision (a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the bankruptcy clerk dockets the first notice.


* (d) EXTENDING THE TIME TO APPEAL.

  * (1) _When the Time May be Extended_. Except as provided in subdivision (d)(2), the bankruptcy court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party's motion that is filed:

    * (A) within the time prescribed by this rule; or

    * (B) within 21 days after that time, if the party shows excusable neglect.


  * (2) _When the Time May Not be Extended_. The bankruptcy court may not extend the time to file a notice of appeal if the judgment, order, or decree appealed from:

    * (A) grants relief from an automatic stay under §362, 922, 1201, or 1301 of the Code;

    * (B) authorizes the sale or lease of property or the use of cash collateral under §363 of the Code;

    * (C) authorizes the obtaining of credit under §364 of the Code;

    * (D) authorizes the assumption or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under §365 of the Code;

    * (E) approves a disclosure statement under §1125 of the Code; or

    * (F) confirms a plan under §943, 1129, 1225, or 1325 of the Code.


  * (3) _Time Limits on an Extension_. No extension of time may exceed 21 days after the time prescribed by this rule, or 14 days after the order granting the motion to extend time is entered, whichever is later.

### Rule 8003. Appeal as of Right—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
* (a) FILING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.

  * (1) _In General_. An appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a district court or BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(1) or (a)(2) may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002.

  * (2) _Effect of Not Taking Other Steps_. An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the district court or BAP to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.

  * (3) _Contents_. The notice of appeal must:

    * (A) conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form;

    * (B) be accompanied by the judgment, order, or decree, or the part of it, being appealed; and

    * (C) be accompanied by the prescribed fee.


  * (4) _Additional Copies_. If requested to do so, the appellant must furnish the bankruptcy clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with subdivision (c).


* (b) JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED APPEALS.

  * (1) _Joint Notice of Appeal_. When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.

  * (2) _Consolidating Appeals_. When parties have separately filed timely notices of appeal, the district court or BAP may join or consolidate the appeals.


* (c) SERVING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.

  * (1) _Serving Parties and Transmitting to the United States Trustee_. The bankruptcy clerk must serve the notice of appeal on counsel of record for each party to the appeal, excluding the appellant, and transmit it to the United States trustee. If a party is proceeding pro se, the clerk must send the notice of appeal to the party's last known address. The clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.

  * (2) _Effect of Failing to Serve or Transmit Notice_. The bankruptcy clerk's failure to serve notice on a party or transmit notice to the United States trustee does not affect the validity of the appeal.

  * (3) _Noting Service on the Docket_. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties served and the date and method of the service.


* (d) TRANSMITTING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE DISTRICT COURT OR BAP; DOCKETING THE APPEAL.

  * (1) _Transmitting the Notice_. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice to the district clerk.

  * (2) _Docketing in the District Court or BAP_. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.

### Rule 8004. Appeal by Leave—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
* (a) NOTICE OF APPEAL AND MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL. To appeal from an interlocutory order or decree of a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), a party must file with the bankruptcy clerk a notice of appeal as prescribed by Rule 8003(a). The notice must:

  * (1) be filed within the time allowed by Rule 8002;

  * (2) be accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal prepared in accordance with subdivision (b); and

  * (3) unless served electronically using the court's transmission equipment, include proof of service in accordance with Rule 8011(d).


* (b) CONTENTS OF THE MOTION; RESPONSE.

  * (1) _Contents_. A motion for leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) must include the following:

    * (A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;

    * (B) the question itself;

    * (C) the relief sought;

    * (D) the reasons why leave to appeal should be granted; and

    * (E) a copy of the interlocutory order or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.


  * (2) _Response_. A party may file with the district or BAP clerk a response in opposition or a cross-motion within 14 days after the motion is served.


* (c) TRANSMITTING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL AND THE MOTION; DOCKETING THE APPEAL; DETERMINING THE MOTION.

  * (1) _Transmitting to the District Court or BAP_. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice and motion to the district clerk.

  * (2) _Docketing in the District Court or BAP_. Upon receiving the notice and motion, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.

  * (3) _Oral Argument Not Required_. The motion and any response or cross-motion are submitted without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.


* (d) FAILURE TO FILE A MOTION WITH A NOTICE OF APPEAL. If an appellant timely files a notice of appeal under this rule but does not include a motion for leave, the district court or BAP may order the appellant to file a motion for leave, or treat the notice of appeal as a motion for leave and either grant or deny it. If the court orders that a motion for leave be filed, the appellant must do so within 14 days after the order is entered, unless the order provides otherwise.

* (e) DIRECT APPEAL TO A COURT OF APPEALS. If leave to appeal an interlocutory order or decree is required under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), an authorization of a direct appeal by the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) satisfies the requirement.

### Rule 8005. Election to Have an Appeal Heard by the District Court Instead of the BAP
* (a) FILING OF A STATEMENT OF ELECTION. To elect to have an appeal heard by the district court, a party must:

  * (1) file a statement of election that conforms substantially to the appropriate Official Form; and

  * (2) do so within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §158(c)(1).


* (b) TRANSMITTING THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE APPEAL. Upon receiving an appellant's timely statement of election, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the district clerk all documents related to the appeal. Upon receiving a timely statement of election by a party other than the appellant, the BAP clerk must transmit to the district clerk all documents related to the appeal and notify the bankruptcy clerk of the transmission.

* (c) DETERMINING THE VALIDITY OF AN ELECTION. A party seeking a determination of the validity of an election must file a motion in the court where the appeal is then pending. The motion must be filed within 14 days after the statement of election is filed.

* (d) MOTION FOR LEAVE WITHOUT A NOTICE OF APPEAL—EFFECT ON THE TIMING OF AN ELECTION. If an appellant moves for leave to appeal under Rule 8004 but fails to file a separate notice of appeal with the motion, the motion must be treated as a notice of appeal for purposes of determining the timeliness of a statement of election.

### Rule 8006. Certifying a Direct Appeal to the Court of Appeals
* (a) EFFECTIVE DATE OF A CERTIFICATION. A certification of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court for direct review in a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) is effective when:

  * (1) the certification has been filed;

  * (2) a timely appeal has been taken under Rule 8003 or 8004; and

  * (3) the notice of appeal has become effective under Rule 8002.


* (b) FILING THE CERTIFICATION. The certification must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending. For purposes of this rule, a matter remains pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date under Rule 8002 of the first notice of appeal from the judgment, order, or decree for which direct review is sought. A matter is pending in the district court or BAP thereafter.

* (c) JOINT CERTIFICATION BY ALL APPELLANTS AND APPELLEES.

  * (1) _How Accomplished_. A joint certification by all the appellants and appellees under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A) must be made by using the appropriate Official Form. The parties may supplement the certification with a short statement of the basis for the certification, which may include the information listed in subdivision (f)(2).

  * (2) _Supplemental Statement by the Court_. Within 14 days after the parties' certification, the bankruptcy court or the court in which the matter is then pending may file a short supplemental statement about the merits of the certification.


* (d) THE COURT THAT MAY MAKE THE CERTIFICATION. Only the court where the matter is pending, as provided in subdivision (b), may certify a direct review on request of parties or on its own motion.

* (e) CERTIFICATION ON THE COURT'S OWN MOTION.

  * (1) _How Accomplished_. A certification on the court's own motion must be set forth in a separate document. The clerk of the certifying court must serve it on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1). The certification must be accompanied by an opinion or memorandum that contains the information required by subdivision (f)(2)(A)–(D).

  * (2) _Supplemental Statement by a Party_. Within 14 days after the court's certification, a party may file with the clerk of the certifying court a short supplemental statement regarding the merits of certification.


* (f) CERTIFICATION BY THE COURT ON REQUEST.

  * (1) _How Requested_. A request by a party for certification that a circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies—or a request by a majority of the appellants and a majority of the appellees—must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree.

  * (2) _Service and Contents_. The request must be served on all parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1), and it must include the following:

    * (A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;

    * (B) the question itself;

    * (C) the relief sought;

    * (D) the reasons why the direct appeal should be allowed, including which circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies; and

    * (E) a copy of the judgment, order, or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.


  * (3) _Time to File a Response or a Cross-Request_. A party may file a response to the request within 14 days after the request is served, or such other time as the court where the matter is pending allows. A party may file a cross-request for certification within 14 days after the request is served, or within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree, whichever occurs first.

  * (4) _Oral Argument Not Required_. The request, cross-request, and any response are submitted without oral argument unless the court where the matter is pending orders otherwise.

  * (5) _Form and Service of the Certification_. If the court certifies a direct appeal in response to the request, it must do so in a separate document. The certification must be served on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1).


* (g) PROCEEDING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS FOLLOWING A CERTIFICATION. Within 30 days after the date the certification becomes effective under subdivision (a), a request for permission to take a direct appeal to the court of appeals must be filed with the circuit clerk in accordance with F.R.App.P. 6(c).

### Rule 8007. Stay Pending Appeal; Bonds; Suspension of Proceedings
* (a) INITIAL MOTION IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

  * (1) _In General_. Ordinarily, a party must move first in the bankruptcy court for the following relief:

    * (A) a stay of a judgment, order, or decree of the bankruptcy court pending appeal;

    * (B) the approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment;

    * (C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending; or

    * (D) the suspension or continuation of proceedings in a case or other relief permitted by subdivision (e).


  * (2) _Time to File_. The motion may be made either before or after the notice of appeal is filed.


* (b) MOTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, THE BAP, OR THE COURT OF APPEALS ON DIRECT APPEAL.

  * (1) _Request for Relief_. A motion for the relief specified in subdivision (a)(1)—or to vacate or modify a bankruptcy court's order granting such relief—may be made in the court where the appeal is pending.

  * (2) _Showing or Statement Required_. The motion must:

    * (A) show that moving first in the bankruptcy court would be impracticable; or

    * (B) if a motion was made in the bankruptcy court, either state that the court has not yet ruled on the motion, or state that the court has ruled and set out any reasons given for the ruling.


  * (3) _Additional Content_. The motion must also include:

    * (A) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied upon;

    * (B) affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and

    * (C) relevant parts of the record.


  * (4) _Serving Notice_. The movant must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.


* (c) FILING A BOND OR OTHER SECURITY. The district court, BAP, or court of appeals may condition relief on filing a bond or other security with the bankruptcy court.

* (d) BOND OR OTHER SECURITY FOR A TRUSTEE OR THE UNITED STATES. The court may require a trustee to file a bond or other security when the trustee appeals. A bond or other security is not required when an appeal is taken by the United States, its officer, or its agency or by direction of any department of the federal government.

* (e) CONTINUATION OF PROCEEDINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. Despite Rule 7062 and subject to the authority of the district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the bankruptcy court may:

  * (1) suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case; or

  * (2) issue any other appropriate orders during the pendency of an appeal to protect the rights of all parties in interest.

### Rule 8008. Indicative Rulings
* (a) RELIEF PENDING APPEAL. If a party files a timely motion in the bankruptcy court for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the bankruptcy court may:

  * (1) defer considering the motion;

  * (2) deny the motion; or

  * (3) state that the court would grant the motion if the court where the appeal is pending remands for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue.


* (b) NOTICE TO THE COURT WHERE THE APPEAL IS PENDING. The movant must promptly notify the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

* (c) REMAND AFTER AN INDICATIVE RULING. If the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the district court or BAP may remand for further proceedings, but it retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the district court or BAP remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the clerk of that court when the bankruptcy court has decided the motion on remand.

### Rule 8009. Record on Appeal; Sealed Documents
* (a) DESIGNATING THE RECORD ON APPEAL; STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES.

  * (1) _Appellant._

    * (A) The appellant must file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellee a designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.

    * (B) The appellant must file and serve the designation and statement within 14 days after:

      * (i) the appellant's notice of appeal as of right becomes effective under Rule 8002; or

      * (ii) an order granting leave to appeal is entered.


  * A designation and statement served prematurely must be treated as served on the first day on which filing is timely.


  * (2) _Appellee and Cross-Appellant_. Within 14 days after being served, the appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record. An appellee who files a cross-appeal must file and serve a designation of additional items to be included in the record and a statement of the issues to be presented on the cross-appeal.

  * (3) _Cross-Appellee_. Within 14 days after service of the cross-appellant's designation and statement, a cross-appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the cross-appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record.

  * (4) _Record on Appeal_. The record on appeal must include the following:

    * • docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk;

    * • items designated by the parties;

    * • the notice of appeal;

    * • the judgment, order, or decree being appealed;

    * • any order granting leave to appeal;

    * • any certification required for a direct appeal to the court of appeals;

    * • any opinion, findings of fact, and conclusions of law relating to the issues on appeal, including transcripts of all oral rulings;

    * • any transcript ordered under subdivision (b);

    * • any statement required by subdivision (c); and

    * • any additional items from the record that the court where the appeal is pending orders.


  * (5) _Copies for the Bankruptcy Clerk_. If paper copies are needed, a party filing a designation of items must provide a copy of any of those items that the bankruptcy clerk requests. If the party fails to do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copy at the party's expense.


* (b) TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS.

  * (1) _Appellant's Duty to Order_. Within the time period prescribed by subdivision (a)(1), the appellant must:

    * (A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or

    * (B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the appellant is not ordering a transcript.


  * (2) _Cross-Appellant's Duty to Order_. Within 14 days after the appellant files a copy of the transcript order or a certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee as cross-appellant must:

    * (A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the cross-appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or

    * (B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the cross-appellant is not ordering a transcript.


  * (3) _Appellee's or Cross-Appellee's Right to Order_. Within 14 days after the appellant or cross-appellant files a copy of a transcript order or certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee or cross-appellee may order in writing from the reporter a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the appellee or cross-appellee considers necessary for the appeal. A copy of the order must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk.

  * (4) _Payment_. At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.

  * (5) _Unsupported Finding or Conclusion_. If the appellant intends to argue on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all relevant testimony and copies of all relevant exhibits.


* (c) STATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN A TRANSCRIPT IS UNAVAILABLE. If a transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be filed within the time prescribed by subdivision (a)(1) and served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the bankruptcy court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the bankruptcy clerk in the record on appeal.

* (d) AGREED STATEMENT AS THE RECORD ON APPEAL. Instead of the record on appeal as defined in subdivision (a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the bankruptcy court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the bankruptcy court. The statement must set forth only those facts alleged and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the court's resolution of the issues. If the statement is accurate, it—together with any additions that the bankruptcy court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal—must be approved by the bankruptcy court and must then be certified to the court where the appeal is pending as the record on appeal. The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit it to the clerk of that court within the time provided by Rule 8010. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 8018(b) or, in the case of a direct appeal to the court of appeals, by F.R.App.P. 30.

* (e) CORRECTING OR MODIFYING THE RECORD.

  * (1) _Submitting to the Bankruptcy Court_. If any difference arises about whether the record accurately discloses what occurred in the bankruptcy court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by the bankruptcy court and the record conformed accordingly. If an item has been improperly designated as part of the record on appeal, a party may move to strike that item.

  * (2) _Correcting in Other Ways_. If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected, and a supplemental record may be certified and transmitted:

    * (A) on stipulation of the parties;

    * (B) by the bankruptcy court before or after the record has been forwarded; or

    * (C) by the court where the appeal is pending.


  * (3) _Remaining Questions_. All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the court where the appeal is pending.


* (f) SEALED DOCUMENTS. A document placed under seal by the bankruptcy court may be designated as part of the record on appeal. In doing so, a party must identify it without revealing confidential or secret information, but the bankruptcy clerk must not transmit it to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending as part of the record. Instead, a party must file a motion with the court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal. If the motion is granted, the movant must notify the bankruptcy court of the ruling, and the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the sealed document to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending.

* (g) OTHER NECESSARY ACTIONS. All parties to an appeal must take any other action necessary to enable the bankruptcy clerk to assemble and transmit the record.

### Rule 8010. Completing and Transmitting the Record
* (a) REPORTER'S DUTIES.

  * (1) _Proceedings Recorded Without a Reporter Present_. If proceedings were recorded without a reporter being present, the person or service selected under bankruptcy court procedures to transcribe the recording is the reporter for purposes of this rule.

  * (2) _Preparing and Filing the Transcript_. The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:

    * (A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript in accordance with Rule 8009(b), the reporter must file in the bankruptcy court an acknowledgment of the request that shows when it was received, and when the reporter expects to have the transcript completed.

    * (B) After completing the transcript, the reporter must file it with the bankruptcy clerk, who will notify the district, BAP, or circuit clerk of its filing.

    * (C) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days after receiving the order, the reporter must request an extension of time from the bankruptcy clerk. The clerk must enter on the docket and notify the parties whether the extension is granted.

    * (D) If the reporter does not file the transcript on time, the bankruptcy clerk must notify the bankruptcy judge.


* (b) CLERK'S DUTIES.

  * (1) _Transmitting the Record—In General_. Subject to Rule 8009(f) and subdivision (b)(5) of this rule, when the record is complete, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending either the record or a notice that the record is available electronically.

  * (2) _Multiple Appeals_. If there are multiple appeals from a judgment, order, or decree, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit a single record.

  * (3) _Receiving the Record_. Upon receiving the record or notice that it is available electronically, the district, BAP, or circuit clerk must enter that information on the docket and promptly notify all parties to the appeal.

  * (4) _If Paper Copies Are Ordered_. If the court where the appeal is pending directs that paper copies of the record be provided, the clerk of that court must so notify the appellant. If the appellant fails to provide them, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare them at the appellant's expense.

  * (5) _When Leave to Appeal is Requested_. Subject to subdivision (c), if a motion for leave to appeal has been filed under Rule 8004, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare and transmit the record only after the district court, BAP, or court of appeals grants leave.

  * • leave to appeal;

  * • dismissal;

  * • a stay pending appeal;

  * • approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or

### Rule 8011. Filing and Service; Signature
* (a) FILING.

  * (1) _With the Clerk_. A document required or permitted to be filed in a district court or BAP must be filed with the clerk of that court.

  * (2) _Method and Timeliness._

    * (A) _Nonelectronic Filing._

      * (i) _In General_. For a document not filed electronically, filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii), filing is timely only if the clerk receives the document within the time fixed for filing.

      * (ii) _Brief or Appendix_. A brief or appendix not filed electronically is also timely filed if, on or before the last day for filing, it is:

        * • mailed to the clerk by first-class mail—or other class of mail that is at least as expeditious—postage prepaid; or

        * • dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days to the clerk.


      * (iii) _Inmate Filing_. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii). A document not filed electronically by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing and:

        * • it is accompanied by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or

        * • the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii).


    * (B) _Electronic Filing._

      * (i) _By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Exceptions_. An entity represented by an attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule.

      * (ii) _By an Unrepresented Individual—When Allowed or Required_. An individual not represented by an attorney:

        * • may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and

        * • may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that includes reasonable exceptions.


      * (iii) _Same as a Written Paper_. A document filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of these rules.


    * (C) _Copies_. If a document is filed electronically, no paper copy is required. If a document is filed by mail or delivery to the district court or BAP, no additional copies are required. But the district court or BAP may require by local rule or by order in a particular case the filing or furnishing of a specified number of paper copies.


  * (3) _Clerk's Refusal of Documents_. The court's clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any document transmitted for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or by any local rule or practice.


* (b) SERVICE OF ALL DOCUMENTS REQUIRED. Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of the filing of a document, serve it on the other parties to the appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.

* (c) MANNER OF SERVICE.

  * (1) _Nonelectronic Service_. Nonelectronic service may be by any of the following:

    * (A) personal delivery;

    * (B) mail; or

    * (C) third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days.


  * (2) _Electronic Service_. Electronic service may be made by sending a document to a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or by using other electronic means that the person served consented to in writing.

  * (3) _When Service Is Complete_. Service by electronic means is complete on filing or sending, unless the person making service receives notice that the document was not received by the person served. Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier.


* (d) PROOF OF SERVICE.

  * (1) _What Is Required_. A document presented for filing must contain either of the following if it was served other than through the court's electronic-filing system:

    * (A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or

    * (B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:

      * (i) the date and manner of service;

      * (ii) the names of the persons served; and

      * (iii) the mail or electronic address, the fax number, or the address of the place of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service, for each person served.


  * (2) _Delayed Proof_. The district or BAP clerk may permit documents to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service, but must require the acknowledgment or proof to be filed promptly thereafter.

  * (3) _Brief or Appendix_. When a brief or appendix is filed, the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which it was filed.


* (e) SIGNATURE. Every document filed electronically must include the electronic signature of the person filing it or, if the person is represented, the electronic signature of counsel. A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. Every document filed in paper form must be signed by the person filing the document or, if the person is represented, by counsel.

### Rule 8012. Disclosure Statement
* (a) NONGOVERNMENTAL CORPORATIONS. Any nongovernmental corporation that is a party to a proceeding in the district court or BAP must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.

* (b) DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE DEBTOR. The debtor, the trustee, or, if neither is a party, the appellant must file a statement that:

  * (1) identifies each debtor not named in the caption; and

  * (2) for each debtor that is a corporation, discloses the information required by Rule 8012(a).


* (c) TIME TO FILE; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. A Rule 8012 statement must:

  * (1) be filed with the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing;

  * (2) be included before the table of contents in the principal brief; and

  * (3) be supplemented whenever the information required by Rule 8012 changes.

### Rule 8013. Motions; Intervention
* (a) CONTENTS OF A MOTION; RESPONSE; REPLY.

  * (1) _Request for Relief_. A request for an order or other relief is made by filing a motion with the district or BAP clerk.

  * (2) _Contents of a Motion._

    * (A) _Grounds and the Relief Sought_. A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.

    * (B) _Motion to Expedite an Appeal_. A motion to expedite an appeal must explain what justifies considering the appeal ahead of other matters. If the district court or BAP grants the motion, it may accelerate the time to transmit the record, the deadline for filing briefs and other documents, oral argument, and the resolution of the appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal may be filed as an emergency motion under subdivision (d).

    * (C) _Accompanying Documents._

      * (i) Any affidavit or other document necessary to support a motion must be served and filed with the motion.

      * (ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.

      * (iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the bankruptcy court's judgment, order, or decree, and any accompanying opinion as a separate exhibit.


    * (D) _Documents Barred or Not Required._

      * (i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.

      * (ii) Unless the court orders otherwise, a notice of motion or a proposed order is not required.


  * (3) _Response and Reply; Time to File_. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise,

    * (A) any party to the appeal may file a response to the motion within 7 days after service of the motion; and

    * (B) the movant may file a reply to a response within 7 days after service of the response, but may only address matters raised in the response.


* (b) DISPOSITION OF A MOTION FOR A PROCEDURAL ORDER. The district court or BAP may rule on a motion for a procedural order—including a motion under Rule 9006(b) or (c)—at any time without awaiting a response. A party adversely affected by the ruling may move to reconsider, vacate, or modify it within 7 days after the procedural order is served.

* (c) ORAL ARGUMENT. A motion will be decided without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.

* (d) EMERGENCY MOTION.

  * (1) _Noting the Emergency_. When a movant requests expedited action on a motion because irreparable harm would occur during the time needed to consider a response, the movant must insert the word "Emergency" before the title of the motion.

  * (2) _Contents of the Motion_. The emergency motion must

    * (A) be accompanied by an affidavit setting out the nature of the emergency;

    * (B) state whether all grounds for it were submitted to the bankruptcy court and, if not, why the motion should not be remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider;

    * (C) include the e-mail addresses, office addresses, and telephone numbers of moving counsel and, when known, of opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties to the appeal; and

    * (D) be served as prescribed by Rule 8011.


  * (3) _Notifying Opposing Parties_. Before filing an emergency motion, the movant must make every practicable effort to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in time for them to respond. The affidavit accompanying the emergency motion must state when and how notice was given or state why giving it was impracticable.


* (e) POWER OF A SINGLE BAP JUDGE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION.

  * (1) _Single Judge's Authority_. A BAP judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal, deny a motion for leave to appeal, or deny a motion for a stay pending appeal if denial would make the appeal moot.

  * (2) _Reviewing a Single Judge's Action_. The BAP may review a single judge's action, either on its own motion or on a party's motion.


* (f) FORM OF DOCUMENTS; LENGTH LIMITS; NUMBER OF COPIES.

  * (1) _Format of a Paper Document_. Rule 27(d)(1) F.R.App.P. applies in the district court or BAP to a paper version of a motion, response, or reply.

  * (2) _Format of an Electronically Filed Document_. A motion, response, or reply filed electronically must comply with the requirements for a paper version regarding covers, line spacing, margins, typeface, and type style. It must also comply with the length limits under paragraph (3).

  * (3) _Length Limits_. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, and excluding the accompanying documents authorized by subdivision (a)(2)(C):

* (g) INTERVENING IN AN APPEAL. Unless a statute provides otherwise, an entity that seeks to intervene in an appeal pending in the district court or BAP must move for leave to intervene and serve a copy of the motion on the parties to the appeal. The motion or other notice of intervention authorized by statute must be filed within 30 days after the appeal is docketed. It must concisely state the movant's interest, the grounds for intervention, whether intervention was sought in the bankruptcy court, why intervention is being sought at this stage of the proceeding, and why participating as an amicus curiae would not be adequate.

In a case involving more than one appellant or appellee, including consolidated cases, any number of appellants or appellees may join in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of another's brief. Parties may also join in reply briefs.

* (f) CITATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITIES. If pertinent and significant authorities come to a party's attention after the party's brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before a decision—a party may promptly advise the district or BAP clerk by a signed submission setting forth the citations. The submission, which must be served on the other parties to the appeal, must state the reasons for the supplemental citations, referring either to the pertinent page of a brief or to a point argued orally. The body of the submission must not exceed 350 words. Any response must be made within 7 days after the party is served, unless the court orders otherwise, and must be similarly limited.

### Rule 8017. Brief of an Amicus Curiae 
* (a) DURING INITIAL CONSIDERATION OF A CASE ON THE MERITS.

  * (1) _Applicability_. This Rule 8017(a) governs amicus filings during a court's initial consideration of a case on the merits.

  * (2) _When Permitted_. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing, but a district court or BAP may prohibit the filing of or may strike an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification. On its own motion, and with notice to all parties to an appeal, the district court or BAP may request a brief by an amicus curiae.

  * (3) _Motion for Leave to File_. The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:

    * (A) the movant's interest; and

    * (B) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the appeal.


  * (4) _Contents and Form_. An amicus brief must comply with Rule 8015. In addition to the requirements of Rule 8015, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a corporation, the brief must include a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 8012. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 8014, but must include the following:

    * (A) a table of contents, with page references;

    * (B) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;

    * (C) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the source of its authority to file;

    * (D) unless the amicus curiae is one listed in the first sentence of subdivision (a)(2), a statement that indicates whether:

      * (i) a party's counsel authored the brief in whole or in part;

      * (ii) a party or a party's counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; and

      * (iii) a person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel— contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such person;


    * (E) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review; and

    * (F) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 8015(h).


  * (5) _Length_. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus brief must be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.

  * (6) _Time for Filing_. An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant's principal brief is filed. The district court or BAP may grant leave for later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.

  * (7) _Reply Brief_. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply brief.

  * (8) _Oral Argument_. An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the district court's or BAP's permission.


* (b) DURING CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER TO GRANT REHEARING.

  * (1) _Applicability_. This Rule 8017(b) governs amicus filings during a district court's or BAP's consideration of whether to grant rehearing, unless a local rule or order in a case provides otherwise.

  * (2) _When Permitted_. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court.

  * (3) _Motion for Leave to File_. Rule 8017(a)(3) applies to a motion for leave.

  * (4) _Contents, Form, and Length_. Rule 8017(a)(4) applies to the amicus brief. The brief must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 2,600 words.

An amicus curiae opposing the motion for rehearing must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than the date set by the court for the response.

### Rule 8018. Serving and Filing Briefs; Appendices
* (a) TIME TO SERVE AND FILE A BRIEF. The following rules apply unless the district court or BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:

  * (1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically.

  * (2) The appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after service of the appellant's brief.

  * (3) The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after service of the appellee's brief, but a reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district court or BAP, for good cause, allows a later filing.

  * (4) If an appellant fails to file a brief on time or within an extended time authorized by the district court or BAP, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal—or the district court or BAP, after notice, may dismiss the appeal on its own motion. An appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral argument unless the district court or BAP grants permission.


* (b) DUTY TO SERVE AND FILE AN APPENDIX TO THE BRIEF.

  * (1) _Appellant_. Subject to subdivision (e) and Rule 8009(d), the appellant must serve and file with its principal brief excerpts of the record as an appendix. It must contain the following:

    * (A) the relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket;

    * (B) the complaint and answer, or other equivalent filings;

    * (C) the judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is taken;

    * (D) any other orders, pleadings, jury instructions, findings, conclusions, or opinions relevant to the appeal;

    * (E) the notice of appeal; and

    * (F) any relevant transcript or portion of it.


  * (2) _Appellee_. The appellee may also serve and file with its brief an appendix that contains material required to be included by the appellant or relevant to the appeal or cross-appeal, but omitted by the appellant.

  * (3) _Cross-Appellee_. The appellant as cross-appellee may also serve and file with its response an appendix that contains material relevant to matters raised initially by the principal brief in the cross-appeal, but omitted by the cross-appellant.


* (c) FORMAT OF THE APPENDIX. The appendix must begin with a table of contents identifying the page at which each part begins. The relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents. Other parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from the transcript of proceedings are placed in the appendix, the transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets immediately before the included pages. Omissions in the text of documents or of the transcript must be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, and the like) should be omitted.

* (d) EXHIBITS. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the appendix may be reproduced in a separate volume or volumes, suitably indexed.

* (e) APPEAL ON THE ORIGINAL RECORD WITHOUT AN APPENDIX. The district court or BAP may, either by rule for all cases or classes of cases or by order in a particular case, dispense with the appendix and permit an appeal to proceed on the original record, with the submission of any relevant parts of the record that the district court or BAP orders the parties to file.

### Rule 8018.1. District-Court Review of a Judgment that the Bankruptcy Court Lacked the Constitutional Authority to Enter
* If, on appeal, a district court determines that the bankruptcy court did not have the power under Article III of the Constitution to enter the judgment, order, or decree appealed from, the district court may treat it as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.

### Rule 8019. Oral Argument
* (a) PARTY'S STATEMENT. Any party may file, or a district court or BAP may require, a statement explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.

* (b) PRESUMPTION OF ORAL ARGUMENT AND EXCEPTIONS. Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless the district judge—or all the BAP judges assigned to hear the appeal—examine the briefs and record and determine that oral argument is unnecessary because

  * (1) the appeal is frivolous;

  * (2) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or

  * (3) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.


* (c) NOTICE OF ARGUMENT; POSTPONEMENT. The district court or BAP must advise all parties of the date, time, and place for oral argument, and the time allowed for each side. A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date.

* (d) ORDER AND CONTENTS OF ARGUMENT. The appellant opens and concludes the argument. Counsel must not read at length from briefs, the record, or authorities.

* (e) CROSS-APPEALS AND SEPARATE APPEALS. If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 8016(b) determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for the purposes of oral argument. Unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.

* (f) NONAPPEARANCE OF A PARTY. If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the district court or BAP may hear the appellant's argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the district court or BAP may hear the appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.

* (g) SUBMISSION ON BRIEFS. The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs, but the district court or BAP may direct that the case be argued.

* (h) USE OF PHYSICAL EXHIBITS AT ARGUMENT; REMOVAL. Counsel intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the exhibits from the courtroom unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives notice to remove them.

### Rule 8020. Frivolous Appeal and Other Misconduct
* (a) FRIVOLOUS APPEAL—DAMAGES AND COSTS. If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.

* (b) OTHER MISCONDUCT. The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or party appearing before it for other misconduct, including failure to comply with any court order. First, however, the court must afford the attorney or party reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

### Rule 8021. Costs
* (a) AGAINST WHOM ASSESSED. The following rules apply unless the law provides or the district court or BAP orders otherwise:

  * (1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree otherwise;

  * (2) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;

  * (3) if a judgment, order, or decree is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;

  * (4) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed or reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the district court or BAP orders.


* (b) COSTS FOR AND AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. Costs for or against the United States, its agency, or its officer may be assessed under subdivision (a) only if authorized by law.

* (c) COSTS ON APPEAL TAXABLE IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. The following costs on appeal are taxable in the bankruptcy court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:

  * (1) the production of any required copies of a brief, appendix, exhibit, or the record;

  * (2) the preparation and transmission of the record;

  * (3) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;

  * (4) premiums paid for a bond or other security to preserve rights pending appeal; and

  * (5) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.


* (d) BILL OF COSTS; OBJECTIONS. A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal, file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve an itemized and verified bill of costs. Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the bankruptcy court extends the time.

### Rule 8022. Motion for Rehearing
* (a) TIME TO FILE; CONTENTS; RESPONSE; ACTION BY THE DISTRICT COURT OR BAP IF GRANTED.

  * (1) _Time_. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, any motion for rehearing by the district court or BAP must be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal.

  * (2) _Contents_. The motion must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the movant believes the district court or BAP has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the motion. Oral argument is not permitted.

  * (3) _Response_. Unless the district court or BAP requests, no response to a motion for rehearing is permitted. But ordinarily, rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request.

  * (4) _Action by the District Court or BAP_. If a motion for rehearing is granted, the district court or BAP may do any of the following:

    * (A) make a final disposition of the appeal without reargument;

    * (B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or

    * (C) issue any other appropriate order.


* (b) FORM OF THE MOTION; LENGTH. The motion must comply in form with Rule 8013(f)(1) and (2). Copies must be served and filed as provided by Rule 8011. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission:

  * (1) a motion for rehearing produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 3,900 words; and

  * (2) a handwritten or typewritten motion must not exceed 15 pages.

### Rule 8023. Voluntary Dismissal
* The clerk of the district court or BAP must dismiss an appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant's motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the district court or BAP.

### Rule 8024. Clerk's Duties on Disposition of the Appeal
* (a) JUDGMENT ON APPEAL. The district or BAP clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment after receiving the court's opinion or, if there is no opinion, as the court instructs. Noting the judgment on the docket constitutes entry of judgment.

* (b) NOTICE OF A JUDGMENT. Immediately upon the entry of a judgment, the district or BAP clerk must:

  * (1) transmit a notice of the entry to each party to the appeal, to the United States trustee, and to the bankruptcy clerk, together with a copy of any opinion; and

  * (2) note the date of the transmission on the docket.


* (c) RETURNING PHYSICAL ITEMS. If any physical items were transmitted as the record on appeal, they must be returned to the bankruptcy clerk on disposition of the appeal.

### Rule 8025. Stay of a District Court or BAP Judgment
* (a) AUTOMATIC STAY OF JUDGMENT ON APPEAL. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, its judgment is stayed for 14 days after entry.

* (b) STAY PENDING APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEALS.

  * (1) _In General_. On a party's motion and notice to all other parties to the appeal, the district court or BAP may stay its judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals.

  * (2) _Time Limit_. The stay must not exceed 30 days after the judgment is entered, except for cause shown.

  * (3) _Stay Continued_. If, before a stay expires, the party who obtained the stay appeals to the court of appeals, the stay continues until final disposition by the court of appeals.

  * (4) _Bond or Other Security_. A bond or other security may be required as a condition for granting or continuing a stay of the judgment. A bond or other security may be required if a trustee obtains a stay, but not if a stay is obtained by the United States or its officer or agency or at the direction of any department of the United States government.


* (c) AUTOMATIC STAY OF AN ORDER, JUDGMENT, OR DECREE OF A BANKRUPTCY COURT. If the district court or BAP enters a judgment affirming an order, judgment, or decree of the bankruptcy court, a stay of the district court's or BAP's judgment automatically stays the bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree for the duration of the appellate stay.

* (d) POWER OF A COURT OF APPEALS NOT LIMITED. This rule does not limit the power of a court of appeals or any of its judges to do the following:

  * (1) stay a judgment pending appeal;

  * (2) stay proceedings while an appeal is pending;

  * (3) suspend, modify, restore, vacate, or grant a stay or an injunction while an appeal is pending; or

  * (4) issue any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of any judgment to be entered.

### Rule 8026. Rules by Circuit Councils and District Courts; Procedure When There is No Controlling Law
* (a) LOCAL RULES BY CIRCUIT COUNCILS AND DISTRICT COURTS.

  * (1) _Adopting Local Rules_. A circuit council that has authorized a BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(b) may make and amend rules governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the BAP. A district court may make and amend rules governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the district court. Local rules must be consistent with, but not duplicative of, Acts of Congress and these Part VIII rules. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making and amending rules to govern appeals.

  * (2) _Numbering_. Local rules must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

  * (3) _Limitation on Imposing Requirements of Form_. A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.


* (b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW.

  * (1) _In General_. A district court or BAP may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official Forms, and local rules.

  * (2) _Limitation on Sanctions_. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official Forms, or local rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.

### Rule 8027. Notice of a Mediation Procedure
* If the district court or BAP has a mediation procedure applicable to bankruptcy appeals, the clerk must notify the parties promptly after docketing the appeal of:

* (a) the requirements of the mediation procedure; and

* (b) any effect the mediation procedure has on the time to file briefs.

### Rule 8028. Suspension of Rules in Part VIII
* In the interest of expediting decision or for other cause in a particular case, the district court or BAP, or where appropriate the court of appeals, may suspend the requirements or provisions of the rules in Part VIII, except Rules 8001, 8002, 8003, 8004, 8005, 8006, 8007, 8012, 8020, 8024, 8025, 8026, and 8028.
