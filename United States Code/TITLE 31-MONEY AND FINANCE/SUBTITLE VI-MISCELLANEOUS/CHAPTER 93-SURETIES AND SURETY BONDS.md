### **CHAPTER 93—SURETIES AND SURETY BONDS**

### §9301. Definitions
* In this chapter—

  * (1) "person" means an individual, a trust, an estate, a partnership, and a corporation.

  * (2) "eligible obligation" means any security designated as acceptable in lieu of a surety bond by the Secretary of the Treasury.

### §9302. Prohibition against surety bonds for United States Government personnel
* An agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) may not require or obtain a surety bond for a member of the uniformed services or an officer or employee of the United States Government in carrying out official duties. This section does not affect the personal financial liability of the member, officer, or employee.

### §9303. Use of eligible obligations instead of surety bonds
* (a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give an eligible obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall—

  * (1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;

  * (2) as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, have a market value that is equal to or greater than the amount of the required surety bond; and

  * (3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.


* (b)(1) An official receiving an eligible obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with—

  * (A) the Secretary of the Treasury;

  * (B) a Federal reserve bank; or

  * (C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.


* (2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.

* (c) Using an eligible obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using—

  * (1) a personal or corporate surety bond;

  * (2) a certified check;

  * (3) a bank draft;

  * (4) a post office money order; or

  * (5) cash.


* (d) When security is no longer required, an eligible obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40, files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3133(a) of title 40, the Government—

  * (1) may return to the contractor the eligible obligation given as security (or proceeds of the eligible obligation given) under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40 only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 3133(b) of title 40; and

  * (2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the eligible obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.


* (e) This section does not affect the—

  * (1) priority of a claim of the Government against an eligible obligation given under this section;

  * (2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under—

    * (A) sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40; or

    * (B) this section;


  * (3) authority of a court over an eligible obligation given as security in a civil action; and

  * (4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive an eligible obligation as security.


* (f) To avoid frequent substitution of eligible obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to an eligible obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.

### §9304. Surety corporations
* (a) When a law of the United States Government requires or permits a person to give a surety bond through a surety, the person satisfies the law if the surety bond is provided for the person by a corporation—

  * (1) incorporated under the laws of—

    * (A) the United States; or

    * (B) a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States;


  * (2) that may under those laws guarantee—

    * (A) the fidelity of persons holding positions of trust; and

    * (B) bonds and undertakings in judicial proceedings; and


  * (3) complying with sections 9305 and 9306 of this title.


* (b) Each surety bond shall be approved by the official of the Government required to approve or accept the bond. The official may not require that the surety bond be given through a guaranty corporation or through any particular guaranty corporation.

### §9305. Authority and revocation of authority of surety corporations
* (a) Before becoming a surety under section 9304 of this title, a surety corporation must file with the Secretary of the Treasury—

  * (1) a copy of the articles of incorporation of the corporation; and

  * (2) a statement of the assets and liabilities of the corporation signed and sworn to by the president and secretary of the corporation.


* (b) The Secretary may authorize in writing a surety corporation to provide surety bonds under section 9304 of this title if the Secretary decides that—

  * (2) the corporation has paid-up capital of at least $250,000 in cash or its equivalent; and

  * (3) the corporation is able to carry out its contracts.


* (c) A surety corporation authorized under subsection (b) of this section to provide surety bonds shall file with the Secretary each January, April, July, and October a statement of the assets and liabilities of the corporation signed and sworn to by the president and secretary of the corporation.

* (d) The Secretary—

  * (1) shall revoke the authority of a surety corporation to do new business if the Secretary decides the corporation is insolvent or is in violation of this section or section 9304 or 9306 of this title;

  * (2) may investigate the solvency of a surety corporation at any time; and

  * (3) may require additional security from the person required to provide a surety bond if the Secretary decides that a surety corporation no longer is sufficient security.


* (e) A surety corporation providing a surety bond under section 9304 of this title may not provide any additional bond under that section if—

  * (1) the corporation does not pay a final judgment or order against it on the bond; and

  * (2) no appeal or stay of the judgment or order is pending 30 days after the judgment or order is entered.

### §9306. Surety corporations acting outside area of incorporation and place of principal office
* (a) A surety corporation may provide a surety bond under section 9304 of this title in a judicial district outside the State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States under whose laws it was incorporated and in which its principal office is located only if the corporation has a resident agent for service of process for that district. The resident agent—

  * (1) may be an official of the State, the District of Columbia, the territory or possession in which the court sits who is authorized or appointed under the law of the State, District, territory or possession to receive service of process on the corporation; or

  * (2) may be an individual who resides in the jurisdiction of the district court for the district in which a surety bond is to be provided and who is appointed by the corporation as provided in subsection (b)


* (b) If the surety corporation meets the requirement of subsection (a) by appointing an individual under subsection (a)(2), the surety corporation shall file a certified copy of the power of attorney with the clerk of the district court for the district in which a surety bond is to be given at each place the court sits. A copy of the power of attorney may be used as evidence in a civil action under section 9307 of this title.

* (c)(1) If a resident agent is removed, resigns, dies, or becomes disabled, the surety corporation shall appoint another agent as described in this section.

* (2) Until an appointment is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection or during an absence of an agent from the district in which the surety bond is given, service of process may be made on the clerk of the court in which a civil action against the corporation is brought. The official serving process on the clerk of the court—

    * (A) immediately shall mail a copy of the process to the corporation; and

    * (B) shall state in the official's return that the official served the process on the clerk of the court.


* (3) A judgment or order of a court entered or made after service of process under this section is as valid as if the corporation were served in the judicial district of the court.

### §9307. Civil actions and judgments against surety corporations
* (a)(1) A surety corporation providing a surety bond under section 9304 of this title may be sued in a court of the United States having jurisdiction of civil actions on surety bonds in—

  * (A) the judicial district in which the surety bond was provided; or

  * (B) the district in which the principal office of the corporation is located.


* (2) Under sections 9304–9308 of this title, a surety bond is deemed to be provided in the district—

  * (A) in which the principal office of the surety corporation is located;

  * (B) to which the surety bond is returnable;

  * (C) in which the surety bond is filed; and

  * (D) in which the person required to provide a surety bond resided when the bond was provided.

A civil action under this section may be brought in a judicial district in which a civil action may be brought against the corporation under section 9307 of this title. A penalty imposed under this section does not affect the validity of a contract made by the surety corporation.

### §9309. Priority of sureties
* When a person required to provide a surety bond given to the United States Government is insolvent or dies having assets insufficient to pay debts, the surety, or the executor, administrator, or assignee of the surety paying the Government the amount due under the bond—

  * (2) personally may bring a civil action under the bond to recover amounts paid under the bond.

### §9310. Individual sureties
* If another applicable Federal law or regulation permits the acceptance of a bond from a surety that is not subject to sections 9305 and 9306 and is based on a pledge of assets by the surety, the assets pledged by such surety shall—
