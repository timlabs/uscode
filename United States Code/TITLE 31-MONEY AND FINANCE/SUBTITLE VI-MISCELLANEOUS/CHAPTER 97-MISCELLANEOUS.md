### **CHAPTER 97—MISCELLANEOUS**

### §9701. Fees and charges for Government services and things of value
* (a) It is the sense of Congress that each service or thing of value provided by an agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) to a person (except a person on official business of the United States Government) is to be self-sustaining to the extent possible.

* (b) The head of each agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) may prescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the agency. Regulations prescribed by the heads of executive agencies are subject to policies prescribed by the President and shall be as uniform as practicable. Each charge shall be—

  * (1) fair; and

  * (2) based on—

    * (A) the costs to the Government;

    * (B) the value of the service or thing to the recipient;

    * (C) public policy or interest served; and

    * (D) other relevant facts.


* (c) This section does not affect a law of the United States—

  * (1) prohibiting the determination and collection of charges and the disposition of those charges; and

  * (2) prescribing bases for determining charges, but a charge may be redetermined under this section consistent with the prescribed bases.

### §9702. Investment of trust funds
* Except as required by a treaty of the United States, amounts held in trust by the United States Government (including annual interest earned on the amounts)—

  * (1) shall be invested in Government obligations; and

  * (2) shall earn interest at an annual rate of at least 5 percent.

### §9703. Managerial accountability and flexibility
* (a) Beginning with fiscal year 1999, the performance plans required under section 1115 may include proposals to waive administrative procedural requirements and controls, including specification of personnel staffing levels, limitations on compensation or remuneration, and prohibitions or restrictions on funding transfers among budget object classification 20 and subclassifications 11, 12, 31, and 32 of each annual budget submitted under section 1105, in return for specific individual or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. In preparing and submitting the performance plan under section 1105(a)(29), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A waiver shall take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the waiver is approved.

* (b) Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in performance resulting from any waiver. The expected improvements shall be compared to current actual performance, and to the projected level of performance that would be achieved independent of any waiver.

* (c) Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or awards, that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet performance goals.

* (d) Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or controls imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency or the Office of Management and Budget) may not be included in a performance plan unless it is endorsed by the agency that established the requirement, and the endorsement included in the proposing agency's performance plan.

* (e) A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a subsequent year. After a waiver has been in effect for three consecutive years, the performance plan prepared under section 1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a waiver of limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made permanent.

* (f) For purposes of this section, the definitions under section 1115(f) shall apply.

### §9704. Pilot projects for managerial accountability and flexibility
* (a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall designate not less than five agencies as pilot projects in managerial accountability and flexibility for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Such agencies shall be selected from those designated as pilot projects under section 1118 and shall reflect a representative range of Government functions and capabilities in measuring and reporting program performance.

* (b) Pilot projects in the designated agencies shall include proposed waivers in accordance with section 9703 for one or more of the major functions and operations of the agency.

* (c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall include in the report to the President and to the Congress required under section 1118(c)—

  * (1) an assessment of the benefits, costs, and usefulness of increasing managerial and organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority in exchange for improved performance through a waiver; and

  * (2) an identification of any significant difficulties experienced by the pilot agencies in preparing proposed waivers.


* (d) For purposes of this section the definitions under section 1115(f) shall apply.
