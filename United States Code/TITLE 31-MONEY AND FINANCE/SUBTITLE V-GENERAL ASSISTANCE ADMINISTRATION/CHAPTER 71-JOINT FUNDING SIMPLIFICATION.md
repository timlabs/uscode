### §7104. Processing project requests to be financed by at least 2 assistance programs
* In processing an application or request for assistance for a project to be financed by at least 2 assistance programs, the head of an executive agency shall take action that will ensure that—

### §7105. Prescribing uniform technical and administrative provisions

* (b) To make easier the processing of applications for assistance, the head of an executive agency may provide for review of proposals for a project by one panel, board, or committee where reviews by separate panels, boards, or committees are not specifically required by law.

* (c) Notwithstanding a requirement that one public agency or a specific public agency be established or designated to carry out or supervise that part of the assistance from the Government under an assistance program for a jointly financed project, the head of the executive agency carrying out the program may waive the requirement when—

  * (1) administration by another public agency is consistent with State or local law and the objectives of the assistance program; and

  * (B) the State or local public agencies concerned agree to the waiver.

### §7106. Delegation of supervision of assistance
* With the approval of the President, the head of an executive agency may delegate or otherwise arrange to have another executive agency carry out or supervise a project or class of projects jointly financed under this chapter. A delegation—

### §7107. Joint management funds
* (a) In supporting a project, a joint management fund may be established to administer more effectively amounts received from more than one assistance program or appropriation.

When a project is completed, the grantee shall return to the fund an amount not expended.

* (b) An account in a joint management fund is subject to an agreement made by the heads of the executive agencies providing assistance for the project about the responsibilities of each agency. An agreement shall—

  * (3) include procedures for returning, subject to fiscal year limitations, an excess amount to participating executive agencies under the applicable appropriation. An excess amount of an expired appropriation lapses from the fund.


* (c) For each project financed through an account in a joint management fund, a recipient of an amount from the fund shall keep records prescribed by the head of the executive agency responsible for administering the fund. The records shall include—

  * (1) the amount and disposition by the recipient of assistance received under each program and appropriation;

  * (2) the total cost of the project for which assistance was given or used;

  * (3) that part of the cost of the project provided from other sources; and

  * (4) other records that will make it easier to carry out an audit.


* (d) Records of a recipient related to an amount received from a joint management fund shall be made available to the head of the executive agency responsible for administering the fund and the Comptroller General for inspection and audit.

* (e) For a project subject to a joint management fund, one non-Government share may be established conforming to—

  * (1) the proportional shares applicable to the assistance programs involved; and

  * (2) the proportional shares of an amount transferred to the project account from each of the programs.

### §7108. Limitation on authority under sections 7105–7107

  * (1) when a problem cannot be adequately solved through other action under this chapter or other law;

  * (2) when necessary to promote expeditious processing of applications or effective and efficient administration of the project; and

  * (3) in a way consistent with protecting the interest of the United States Government and with the program purposes and requirements of law.
