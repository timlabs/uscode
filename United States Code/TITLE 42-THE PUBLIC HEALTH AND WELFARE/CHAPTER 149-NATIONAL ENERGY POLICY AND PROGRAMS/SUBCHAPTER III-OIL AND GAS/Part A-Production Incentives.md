  * The Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking and grant royalty relief under this section as a suspension volume if the Secretary determines that such royalty relief would encourage production of natural gas from gas hydrate resources from an eligible lease. The maximum suspension volume shall be 30 billion cubic feet of natural gas per lease. Such relief shall be in addition to any other royalty relief under any other provision applicable to the lease that does not specifically grant a gas hydrate production incentive. Such royalty suspension volume shall be applied to any eligible production occurring on or after the date of publication of the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.

* #### (4) Limitation
  * The Secretary may place limitations on royalty relief granted under this section based on market price.

#### (c) Application
* This section shall apply to any eligible lease issued before, on, or after August 8, 2005.

#### (d) Rulemakings
* #### (1) Requirement
  * The Secretary shall publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 days after August 8, 2005, and complete the rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after August 8, 2005.

* #### (2) Gas hydrate resources defined
  * Such regulations shall define the term "gas hydrate resources" to include both the natural gas content of gas hydrates within the hydrate stability zone and free natural gas trapped by and beneath the hydrate stability zone.

#### (e) Review
* Not later than 365 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall carry out a review of, and submit to Congress a report on, further opportunities to enhance production of natural gas from gas hydrate resources on the outer Continental Shelf and on Federal lands in Alaska through the provision of other production incentives or through technical or financial assistance.

### §15910. Enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection
#### (a) Production incentive
* #### (1) Findings
  * Congress finds the following:

    * (A) Approximately two-thirds of the original oil in place in the United States remains unproduced.

    * (B) Enhanced oil and natural gas production from the sequestering of carbon dioxide and other appropriate gases has the potential to increase oil and natural gas production.

    * (C) Capturing and productively using carbon dioxide would help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy.

* #### (2) Purpose
  * The purpose of this section is—

    * (A) to promote the capturing, transportation, and injection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon dioxide, and other appropriate gases or other matter for sequestration into oil and gas fields; and

    * (B) to promote oil and natural gas production from the outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal lands under lease by providing royalty incentives to use enhanced recovery techniques using injection of the substances referred to in subparagraph (A).

#### (b) Suspension of royalties
* #### (1) In general
  * If the Secretary determines that reduction of the royalty under a Federal oil and gas lease that is an eligible lease is in the public interest and promotes the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall undertake a rulemaking to provide for such reduction for an eligible lease.

* #### (2) Rulemakings
  * The Secretary shall publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 days after August 8, 2005, and complete the rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after August 8, 2005.

* #### (3) Eligible leases
  * A lease shall be an eligible lease for purposes of this section if—

    * (A) it is a lease for production of oil and gas from the outer Continental Shelf or Federal onshore lands;

    * (B) the injection of the substances referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) will be used as an enhanced recovery technique on such lease; and

    * (C) the Secretary determines that the lease contains oil or gas that would not likely be produced without the royalty reduction provided under this section.

* #### (4) Amount of relief
  * The rulemaking shall provide for a suspension volume, which shall not exceed 5,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent for each eligible lease. Such suspension volume shall be applied to any production from an eligible lease occurring on or after the date of publication of any advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection.

* #### (5) Limitation
  * The Secretary may place limitations on the royalty reduction granted under this section based on market price.

* #### (6) Application
  * This section shall apply to any eligible lease issued before, on, or after August 8, 2005.
