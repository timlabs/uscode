  * (A) such action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of such program or activity; or

### §6104. Enforcement
#### (a) Methods of achieving compliance with regulations
* The head of any Federal department or agency who prescribes regulations under section 6103 of this title may seek to achieve compliance with any such regulation—

  * (1) by terminating, or refusing to grant or to continue, assistance under the program or activity involved to any recipient with respect to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with any such regulation; or

  * (2) by any other means authorized by law.

#### (b) Limitations on termination of, or on refusal to grant or to continue, assistance; disbursement of withheld funds to achiever agencies
* Any termination of, or refusal to grant or to continue, assistance under subsection (a)(1) shall be limited to the particular political entity or other recipient with respect to which a finding has been made under subsection (a)(1). Any such termination or refusal shall be limited in its effect to the particular program or activity, or part of such program or activity, with respect to which such finding has been made. No such termination or refusal shall be based in whole or in part on any finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive Federal financial assistance. Whenever the head of any Federal department or agency who prescribes regulations under section 6103 of this title withholds funds pursuant to subsection (a), he may, in accordance with regulations he shall prescribe, disburse the funds so withheld directly to any public or nonprofit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision thereof, which demonstrates the ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute authorizing the program or activity while complying with regulations issued under section 6103 of this title.

#### (c) Advice as to failure to comply with regulation; determination that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means
* No action may be taken under subsection (a) until the head of the Federal department or agency involved has advised the appropriate person of the failure to comply with the regulation involved and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.

#### (d) Report to Congressional committees
* In the case of any action taken under subsection (a), the head of the Federal department or agency involved shall transmit a written report of the circumstances and grounds of such action to the committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. No such action shall take effect until thirty days after the transmission of any such report.

#### (e) Injunctions; notice of violations; costs; conditions for actions
* (1) When any interested person brings an action in any United States district court for the district in which the defendant is found or transacts business to enjoin a violation of this Act by any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, such interested person shall give notice by registered mail not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of that action to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States, and the person against whom the action is directed. Such interested person may elect, by a demand for such relief in his complaint, to recover reasonable attorney's fees, in which case the court shall award the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to the prevailing plaintiff.

* (2) The notice referred to in paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the alleged violation, the relief to be requested, the court in which the action will be brought, and whether or not attorney's fees are being demanded in the event that the plaintiff prevails. No action described in paragraph (1) shall be brought (A) if at the time the action is brought the same alleged violation by the same defendant is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States; or (B) if administrative remedies have not been exhausted.

#### (f) Exhaustion of administrative remedies
* With respect to actions brought for relief based on an alleged violation of the provisions of this chapter, administrative remedies shall be deemed exhausted upon the expiration of 180 days from the filing of an administrative complaint during which time the Federal department or agency makes no finding with regard to the complaint, or upon the day that the Federal department or agency issues a finding in favor of the recipient of financial assistance, whichever occurs first.

### §6105. Judicial review
#### (a) Provisions of other laws
* Any action by any Federal department or agency under section 6104 of this title shall be subject to such judicial review as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by any such department or agency on other grounds.

#### (b) Provisions of chapter 7 of title 5; reviewable agency discretion
* In the case of any action by any Federal department or agency under section 6104 of this title which is not otherwise subject to judicial review, any person aggrieved (including any State or political subdivision thereof and any agency of either) may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of title 5. For purposes of this subsection, any such action shall not be considered committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 701(a)(2) of such title.

### §6106. Study of discrimination based on age
#### (a) Study by Commission on Civil Rights
* The Commission on Civil Rights shall (1) undertake a study of unreasonable discrimination based on age in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance; and (2) identify with particularity any such federally assisted program or activity in which there is found evidence of persons who are otherwise qualified being, on the basis of age, excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under such program or activity.

#### (b) Public hearings
* As part of the study required by this section, the Commission shall conduct public hearings to elicit the views of interested parties, including Federal departments and agencies, on issues relating to age discrimination in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, and particularly with respect to the reasonableness of distinguishing, on the basis of age, among potential participants in, or beneficiaries of, specific federally assisted programs.

#### (c) Publication of results of analyses, research and studies by independent experts; services of voluntary or uncompensated personnel
* The Commission is authorized to obtain, through grant or contract, analyses, research and studies by independent experts of issues relating to age discrimination and to publish the results thereof. For purposes of the study required by this section, the Commission may accept and utilize the services of voluntary or uncompensated personnel, without regard to the provisions of section 105(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (42 U.S.C. 1975d(b)).

The Commission is authorized to provide, upon request, information and technical assistance regarding its findings and recommendations to Congress, to the President, and to the heads of Federal departments and agencies for a ninety-day period following the transmittal of its report.

#### (e) Comments and recommendations of Federal departments and agencies; submission to President and Congressional committees
* Not later than forty-five working days after receiving a copy of the report required by subsection (d), each Federal department or agency with respect to which the Commission makes findings or recommendations shall submit its comments and recommendations regarding such report to the President and to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives.

#### (f) Cooperation of Federal departments and agencies with Commission
* The head of each Federal department or agency shall cooperate in all respects with the Commission with respect to the study required by subsection (a), and shall provide to the Commission such data, reports, and documents in connection with the subject matter of such study as the Commission may request.

#### (g) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
