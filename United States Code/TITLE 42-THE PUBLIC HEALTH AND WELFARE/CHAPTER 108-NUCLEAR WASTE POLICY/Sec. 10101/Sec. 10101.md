Such term includes the high-level radioactive waste form, high-level radioactive waste canisters, and other materials placed over and around such canisters.

  * (12) The term "high-level radioactive waste" means—

    * (A) the highly radioactive material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material derived from such liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations; and

    * (B) other highly radioactive material that the Commission, consistent with existing law, determines by rule requires permanent isolation.


  * (13) The term "Federal agency" means any Executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5.

  * (16) The term "low-level radioactive waste" means radioactive material that—

    * (A) is not high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, transuranic waste, or by-product material as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title; and

    * (B) the Commission, consistent with existing law, classifies as low-level radioactive waste.


  * (17) The term "Office" means the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management established in section 10224 of this title.

  * (18) The term "repository" means any system licensed by the Commission that is intended to be used for, or may be used for, the permanent deep geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, whether or not such system is designed to permit the recovery, for a limited period during initial operation, of any materials placed in such system. Such term includes both surface and subsurface areas at which high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel handling activities are conducted.

  * (19) The term "reservation" means—

    * (A) any Indian reservation or dependent Indian community referred to in clause (a) or (b) of section 1151 of title 18; or

    * (B) any land selected by an Alaska Native village or regional corporation under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).


  * (20) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Energy.

  * (21) The term "site characterization" means—

    * (A) siting research activities with respect to a test and evaluation facility at a candidate site; and

    * (B) activities, whether in the laboratory or in the field, undertaken to establish the geologic condition and the ranges of the parameters of a candidate site relevant to the location of a repository, including borings, surface excavations, excavations of exploratory shafts, limited subsurface lateral excavations and borings, and in situ testing needed to evaluate the suitability of a candidate site for the location of a repository, but not including preliminary borings and geophysical testing needed to assess whether site characterization should be undertaken.


  * (22) The term "siting research" means activities, including borings, surface excavations, shaft excavations, subsurface lateral excavations and borings, and in situ testing, to determine the suitability of a site for a test and evaluation facility.

  * (23) The term "spent nuclear fuel" means fuel that has been withdrawn from a nuclear reactor following irradiation, the constituent elements of which have not been separated by reprocessing.

  * (24) The term "State" means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States.
