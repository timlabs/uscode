An objective of any demonstration program under this Act shall be to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of energy technologies.

* (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, in carrying out research, development, and demonstration programs and activities under this Act, the Secretary may use, to the extent authorized under applicable provisions of law, contracts, cooperative agreements, cooperative research and development agreements under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 [15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.], grants, joint ventures, and any other form of agreement available to the Secretary.

An objective of any commercial application program under this Act shall be to accelerate the transition of technologies from the research and development stage.

#### (c) "Joint venture" defined
* For purposes of this section, the term "joint venture" has the meaning given the term "joint research and development venture" under section 4301(a)(6) and (b) of title 15, except that such term may apply under this section to research, development, demonstration, and commercial application joint ventures.

#### (e) Guidelines and procedures
* The Secretary shall provide guidelines and procedures for the transition, where appropriate, of energy technologies from research through development and demonstration under subsection (a) to commercial application under subsection (b). Nothing in this section shall preclude the Secretary from—

  * (1) entering into a contract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 [15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.], grant, joint venture, or any other form of agreement available to the Secretary under this section that relates to research, development, demonstration, and commercial application; or

  * (2) extending a contract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, grant, joint venture, or any other form of agreement available to the Secretary that relates to research, development, and demonstration to cover commercial application.

#### (f) Application of section
* This section shall not apply to any contract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 [15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.], grant, joint venture, or any other form of agreement available to the Secretary that is in effect as of October 24, 1992.

### §13542. Cost sharing
#### (a) Research and development
* Except as otherwise provided in this Act, for research and development programs carried out under this Act, the Secretary shall require a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 20 percent of the cost of the project.

The Secretary may reduce the non-Federal requirement under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the reduction is necessary and appropriate considering the technological risks involved in the project and is necessary to meet the objectives of this Act.

#### (c) Calculation of amount
* In calculating the amount of the non-Federal commitment under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary shall include cash, personnel, services, equipment, and other resources.
