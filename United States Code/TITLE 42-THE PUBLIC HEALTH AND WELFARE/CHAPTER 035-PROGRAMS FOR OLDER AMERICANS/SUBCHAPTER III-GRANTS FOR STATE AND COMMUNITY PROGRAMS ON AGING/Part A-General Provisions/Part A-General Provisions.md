Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any action of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

* (5)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, of the funds received by a State attributable to funds appropriated under subsection (a)(1), and paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b), of section 3023 of this title, the State may elect to transfer not more than 30 percent for any fiscal year between programs under part B and part C, for use as the State considers appropriate.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.].

* (2) The Secretary of Agriculture shall determine and report to the Secretary, by such date as the Secretary may require, the amount (if any) of its allotment under subsection (b) which each State agency and title VI [subchapter X] grantee has elected to receive in the form of commodities. Such amount shall include an amount bearing the same ratio to the costs to the Secretary of Agriculture of providing such commodities under this subsection as the value of commodities received by such State agency or title VI [subchapter X] grantee under this subsection bears to the total value of commodities so received.

* #### (2) Plans
  * Prior to the implementation of cost sharing under subsection (a), each State and area agency on aging shall develop plans that are designed to ensure that the participation of low-income older individuals (with particular attention to low-income older individuals, including low-income minority older individuals, older individuals with limited English proficiency, and older individuals residing in rural areas) receiving services will not decrease with the implementation of the cost sharing under such subsection.

#### (d) Evaluation

If the Assistant Secretary finds that there is a disparate impact upon low-income or minority older individuals or older individuals residing in rural areas in any State or region within the State regarding the provision of services, the Assistant Secretary shall take corrective action to assure that such services are provided to all older individuals without regard to the cost sharing criteria.

### §3030c–3. Waivers
#### (a) In general

  * (4) the State agency has given adequate consideration to the probable positive and negative consequences of approval of the waiver application, and the probable benefits for older individuals can reasonably be expected to outweigh any negative consequences, or particular circumstances in the State otherwise justify the waiver.

#### (b) Requirements subject to waiver
* The provisions of this subchapter that may be waived under this section are—

  * (1) any provision of sections 3025, 3026, and 3027 of this title requiring statewide uniformity of programs carried out under this subchapter, to the extent necessary to permit demonstrations, in limited areas of a State, of innovative approaches to assist older individuals;

  * (2) any area plan requirement described in section 3026(a) of this title if granting the waiver will promote innovations or improve service delivery and will not diminish services already provided under this chapter;

#### (d) Reports to Secretary
* With respect to each waiver granted under this section, not later than 1 year after the expiration of such waiver, and at any time during the waiver period that the Assistant Secretary may require, the State agency shall prepare and submit to the Assistant Secretary a report evaluating the impact of the waiver on the operation and effectiveness of programs and services provided under this subchapter.
