  * (2) the State plan has been so changed that it no longer complies substantially with the provisions of subsection (a), or

* the Assistant Secretary shall notify such State agency that no further payments from its allotments under section 3024 of this title and section 3028 of this title will be made to the State (or, in the Assistant Secretary's discretion, that further payments to the State will be limited to projects under or portions of the State plan not affected by such failure), until the Assistant Secretary is satisfied that there will no longer be any failure to comply. Until the Assistant Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to such State from its allotments under section 3024 of this title and section 3028 of this title (or payments shall be limited to projects under or portions of the State plan not affected by such failure). The Assistant Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations the Assistant Secretary shall prescribe, disburse the funds so withheld directly to any public or nonprofit private organization or agency or political subdivision of such State submitting an approved plan in accordance with the provisions of this section. Any such payment shall be matched in the proportions specified in section 3024 of this title.

* (2) Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Assistant Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, but until the filing of the record, the Assistant Secretary may modify or set aside the Assistant Secretary's order. The findings of the Assistant Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Assistant Secretary to take further evidence, and the Assistant Secretary shall, within 30 days, file in the court the record of those further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any action of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

* (3) The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, unless so specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Assistant Secretary's action.

* (2) The Secretary of Agriculture shall determine and report to the Secretary, by such date as the Secretary may require, the amount (if any) of its allotment under subsection (b) which each State agency and title VI [subchapter X] grantee has elected to receive in the form of commodities. Such amount shall include an amount bearing the same ratio to the costs to the Secretary of Agriculture of providing such commodities under this subsection as the value of commodities received by such State agency or title VI [subchapter X] grantee under this subsection bears to the total value of commodities so received.

* (3) From the allotment under subsection (b) for each State agency and title VI [subchapter X] grantee, the Secretary shall transfer funds to the Secretary of Agriculture for the costs of commodities received by such State agency or grantee, and expenses related to the procurement of the commodities on behalf of such State agency or grantee, under this subsection, and shall then pay the balance (if any) to such State agency or grantee.

#### (b) Requirements subject to waiver
* The provisions of this subchapter that may be waived under this section are—

  * (1) any provision of sections 3025, 3026, and 3027 of this title requiring statewide uniformity of programs carried out under this subchapter, to the extent necessary to permit demonstrations, in limited areas of a State, of innovative approaches to assist older individuals;
