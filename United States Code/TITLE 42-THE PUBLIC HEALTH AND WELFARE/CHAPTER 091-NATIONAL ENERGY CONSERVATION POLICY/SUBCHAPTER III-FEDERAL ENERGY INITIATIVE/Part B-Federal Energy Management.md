### PART B—FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT

### §8251. Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) the Federal Government is the largest single energy consumer in the Nation;

  * (2) the cost of meeting the Federal Government's energy requirement is substantial;

  * (3) there are significant opportunities in the Federal Government to conserve and make more efficient use of energy through improved operations and maintenance, the use of new energy efficient technologies, and the application and achievement of energy efficient design and construction;

  * (4) Federal energy conservation measures can be financed at little or no cost to the Federal Government by using private investment capital made available through contracts authorized by subchapter VII of this chapter; and

  * (5) an increase in energy efficiency by the Federal Government would benefit the Nation by reducing the cost of government, reducing national dependence on foreign energy resources, and demonstrating the benefits of greater energy efficiency to the Nation.

### §8252. Purpose
* It is the purpose of this part to promote the conservation and the efficient use of energy and water, and the use of renewable energy sources, by the Federal Government.

### §8253. Energy and water management requirements
#### (a) Energy performance requirement for Federal buildings
* (1) Subject to paragraph (2), each agency shall apply energy conservation measures to, and shall improve the design for the construction of, the Federal buildings of the agency (including each industrial or laboratory facility) so that the energy consumption per gross square foot of the Federal buildings of the agency in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 is reduced, as compared with the energy consumption per gross square foot of the Federal buildings of the agency in fiscal year 2003, by the percentage specified in the following table:
