No subsidy shall be provided to a targeted low-income child under this paragraph unless the child (or the child's parent) voluntarily elects to receive such a subsidy. A State may not require such an election as a condition of receipt of child health assistance.

  * #### (B) Qualified employer-sponsored coverage
    * #### (i) In general
      * Subject to clause (ii), in this paragraph, the term "qualified employer-sponsored coverage" means a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer—

  * #### (C) Premium assistance subsidy
    * #### (i) In general
      * In this paragraph, the term "premium assistance subsidy" means, with respect to a targeted low-income child, the amount equal to the difference between the employee contribution required for enrollment only of the employee under qualified employer-sponsored coverage and the employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee and the child in such coverage, less any applicable premium cost-sharing applied under the State child health plan (subject to the limitations imposed under section 1397cc(e) of this title, including the requirement to count the total amount of the employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee and the child in such coverage toward the annual aggregate cost-sharing limit applied under paragraph (3)(B) of such section).

      * (i) the amount of the premium assistance subsidy shall be increased to take into account the cost of the enrollment of the parent in the qualified employer-sponsored coverage or, at the option of the State if the State determines it cost-effective, the cost of the enrollment of the child's family in such coverage; and

      * (ii) any reference in this paragraph to a child is deemed to include a reference to the parent or, if applicable under clause (i), the family of the child.

  * #### (I) Additional State option for providing premium assistance
    * #### (i) In general
      * A State may establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least 1 employee who is a pregnant woman eligible for assistance under the State child health plan (including through the application of an option described in section 1397ll(f) of this title) or a member of a family with at least 1 targeted low-income child and to provide a premium assistance subsidy under this paragraph for enrollment in coverage made available through such pool.

    * #### (ii) Access to choice of coverage
      * A State that elects the option under clause (i) shall identify and offer access to not less than 2 private health plans that are health benefits coverage that is equivalent to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package described in section 1397cc(b) of this title or benchmark-equivalent coverage that meets the requirements of section 1397cc(a)(2) of this title for employees described in clause (i).

      * (i) include on any application or enrollment form for child health assistance a notice of the availability of premium assistance subsidies for the enrollment of targeted low-income children in qualified employer-sponsored coverage;

      * (ii) provide, as part of the application and enrollment process under the State child health plan, information describing the availability of such subsidies and how to elect to obtain such a subsidy; and

* #### (2) In amounts of payment expended for certain State-funded health insurance programs for children

      * (ii) the total of such expenditures in fiscal year 1996.

  * #### (B) State children's health insurance expenditures

During the period that begins on October 1, 2019, and ends on September 30, 2027, the preceding sentence shall only apply with respect to children in families whose income does not exceed 300 percent of the poverty line (as defined in section 1397jj(c)(5) of this title) applicable to a family of the size involved. The preceding sentences shall not be construed as preventing a State during any such periods from—

  * #### (B) Assurance of exchange coverage for targeted low-income children unable to be provided child health assistance as a result of funding shortfalls
    * In the event that allotments provided under section 1397dd of this title are insufficient to provide coverage to all children who are eligible to be targeted low-income children under the State child health plan under this subchapter, a State shall establish procedures to ensure that such children are screened for eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX or a waiver of that plan and, if found eligible, enrolled in such plan or a waiver. In the case of such children who, as a result of such screening, are determined to not be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or a waiver under subchapter XIX, the State shall establish procedures to ensure that the children are enrolled in a qualified health plan that has been certified by the Secretary under subparagraph (C) and is offered through an Exchange established by the State under section 18031 of this title. For purposes of eligibility for premium assistance for the purchase of a qualified health plan under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and reduced cost-sharing under section 18071 of this title, children described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be ineligible for coverage under the State child health plan.

#### (f) Flexibility in submittal of claims
* Nothing in this section or subsections (e) and (f) of section 1397dd of this title shall be construed as preventing a State from claiming as expenditures in the quarter expenditures that were incurred in a previous quarter.

#### (g) Authority for qualifying States to use certain funds for medicaid expenditures

    * #### (iii) No impact on determination of budget neutrality for waivers
      * In the case of a qualifying State that uses amounts paid under this subsection for expenditures described in clause (ii) that are incurred under a waiver approved for the State, any budget neutrality determinations with respect to such waiver shall be determined without regard to such amounts paid.

* #### (2) Qualifying State
  * In this subsection, the term "qualifying State" means a State that, on and after April 15, 1997, has an income eligibility standard that is at least 184 percent of the poverty line with respect to any 1 or more categories of children (other than infants) who are eligible for medical assistance under section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title or, in the case of a State that has a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on August 1, 1994, or July 1, 1995, has an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line, or, in the case of a State that has a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on January 1, 1994, has an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children who lack health insurance that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line, or, in the case of a State that had a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on October 1, 1993, had an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children that was at least 185 percent of the poverty line and on and after July 1, 1998, has an income eligibility standard for children under section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title or a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line.
