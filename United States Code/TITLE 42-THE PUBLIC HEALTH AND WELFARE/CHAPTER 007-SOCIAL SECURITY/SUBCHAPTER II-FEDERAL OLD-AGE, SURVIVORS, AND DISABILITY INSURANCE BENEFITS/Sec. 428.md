No application under this section which is filed by an individual more than 3 months before the first month in which he or she meets the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall be accepted as an application for purposes of this section.

#### (b) Amount of benefits
* The benefit amount to which an individual is entitled under this section for any month shall be the larger of $64.40 or the amount most recently established in lieu thereof under section 415(i) of this title.

#### (c) Reduction for government pension system benefits
* (1) The benefit amount of any individual under this section for any month shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any periodic benefit under a governmental pension system for which he or she is eligible for such month.

* (2) In the case of a husband and wife only one of whom is entitled to benefits under this section for any month, the benefit amount, after any reduction under paragraph (1), shall be further reduced (but not below zero) by the excess (if any) of (A) the total amount of any periodic benefits under governmental pension systems for which the spouse who is not entitled to benefits under this section is eligible for such month, over (B) the benefit amount as determined without regard to this subsection.

* (3) In the case of a husband or wife both of whom are entitled to benefits under this section for any month, the benefit amount of each spouse, after any reduction under paragraph (1), shall be further reduced (but not below zero) by the excess (if any) of (A) the total amount of any periodic benefits under governmental pension systems for which the other spouse is eligible for such month, over (B) the benefit amount of such other spouse as determined without regard to this subsection.

* (4) For purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an individual is eligible for periodic benefits under a governmental pension system—

  * (A) such individual shall be deemed to have filed application for such benefits,

  * (B) to the extent that entitlement depends on an application by such individual's spouse, such spouse shall be deemed to have filed application, and

  * (C) to the extent that entitlement depends on such individual or his or her spouse having retired, such individual and his or her spouse shall be deemed to have retired before the month for which the determination of eligibility is being made.


* (5) For purposes of this subsection, if any periodic benefit is payable on any basis other than a calendar month, the Commissioner of Social Security shall allocate the amount of such benefit to the appropriate calendar months.

* (6) If, under the foregoing provisions of this section, the amount payable for any month would be less than $1, such amount shall be reduced to zero. In the case of a husband and wife both of whom are entitled to benefits under this section for the month, the preceding sentence shall be applied with respect to the aggregate amount so payable for such month.

* (7) If any benefit amount computed under the foregoing provisions of this section is not a multiple of $0.10, it shall be raised to the next higher multiple of $0.10.

* (8) Under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, benefit payments under this section to an individual (or aggregate benefit payments under this section in the case of a husband and wife) of less than $5 may be accumulated until they equal or exceed $5.

#### (d) Suspension for months in which cash payments are made under public assistance or in which supplemental security income benefits are payable
* The benefit to which any individual is entitled under this section for any month shall not be paid for such month if—

  * (2) such individual's husband or wife receives such aid or assistance in such month, and under the State plan the needs of such individual were taken into account in determining eligibility for (or amount of) such aid or assistance,


* unless the State agency administering or supervising the administration of such plan notifies the Commissioner of Social Security, at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security, that such payments to such individual (or such individual's husband or wife) under such plan are being terminated with the payment or payments made in such month and such individual is not an individual with respect to whom supplemental security income benefits are payable pursuant to subchapter XVI or section 211 of Public Law 93–66 for the following month, nor shall such benefit be paid for such month if such individual is an individual with respect to whom supplemental security income benefits are payable pursuant to subchapter XVI or section 211 of Public Law 93–66 for such month, unless the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such benefits are not payable with respect to such individual for the month following such month.

#### (e) Suspension where individual is residing outside United States
* The benefit to which any individual is entitled under this section for any month shall not be paid if, during such month, such individual is not a resident of the United States. For purposes of this subsection, the term "United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

#### (f) Treatment as monthly insurance benefits
* For purposes of subsections (t) and (u) of section 402 of this title, and of section 1395s of this title, a monthly benefit under this section shall be treated as a monthly insurance benefit payable under section 402 of this title.
