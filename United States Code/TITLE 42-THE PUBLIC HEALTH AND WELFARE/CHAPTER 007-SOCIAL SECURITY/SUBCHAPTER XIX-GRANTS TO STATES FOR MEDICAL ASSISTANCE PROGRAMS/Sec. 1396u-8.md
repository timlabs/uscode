### §1396u–8. Health opportunity accounts
#### (a) Authority
* #### (1) In general
  * Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish a demonstration program under which States may provide under their State plans under this subchapter (including such a plan operating under a statewide waiver under section 1315 of this title) in accordance with this section for the provision of alternative benefits consistent with subsection (c) for eligible population groups in one or more geographic areas of the State specified by the State. An amendment under the previous sentence is referred to in this section as a "State demonstration program".

* #### (2) Initial demonstration
  * #### (A) In general
    * The demonstration program under this section shall begin on January 1, 2007. During the first 5 years of such program, the Secretary shall not approve more than 10 States to conduct demonstration programs under this section, with each State demonstration program covering 1 or more geographic areas specified by the State. After such 5-year period—

      * (i) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended or made permanent in the State; and

      * (ii) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration programs.

  * #### (B) GAO report
    * #### (i) In general
      * Not later than 3 months after the end of the 5-year period described in subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the demonstration programs conducted under this section during such period.

    * #### (ii) Appropriation
      * Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated to the Comptroller General of the United States, $550,000 for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2010 to carry out clause (i).

* #### (3) Approval
  * The Secretary shall not approve a State demonstration program under paragraph (1) unless the program includes the following:

    * (A) Creating patient awareness of the high cost of medical care.

    * (B) Providing incentives to patients to seek preventive care services.

    * (C) Reducing inappropriate use of health care services.

    * (D) Enabling patients to take responsibility for health outcomes.

    * (E) Providing enrollment counselors and ongoing education activities.

    * (F) Providing transactions involving health opportunity accounts to be conducted electronically and without cash.

    * (G) Providing access to negotiated provider payment rates consistent with this section.


* Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a State demonstration program from providing incentives for patients obtaining appropriate preventive care (as defined for purposes of section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.

* #### (4) No requirement for statewideness
  * Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall be construed to require that a State must provide for the implementation of a State demonstration program on a Statewide basis.

#### (b) Eligible population groups
* #### (1) In general
  * A State demonstration program under this section shall specify the eligible population groups consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3).

* #### (2) Eligibility limitations during initial demonstration period
  * During the initial 5 years of the demonstration program under this section, a State demonstration program shall not apply to any of the following individuals:

    * (A) Individuals who are 65 years of age or older.

    * (B) Individuals who are disabled, regardless of whether or not their eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter is based on such disability.

    * (C) Individuals who are eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter only because they are (or were within the previous 60 days) pregnant.

    * (D) Individuals who have been eligible for medical assistance for a continuous period of less than 3 months.

* #### (3) Additional limitations
  * A State demonstration program shall not apply to any individual within a category of individuals described in section 1396u–7(a)(2)(B) of this title.

* #### (4) Limitations
  * #### (A) State option
    * This subsection shall not be construed as preventing a State from further limiting eligibility.

  * #### (B) On enrollees in Medicaid managed care organizations
    * Insofar as the State provides for eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, such individuals may participate in the State demonstration program only if the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the following conditions are met with respect to any such organization:

      * (i) In no case may the number of such individuals enrolled in the organization who participate in the program exceed 5 percent of the total number of individuals enrolled in such organization.

      * (ii) The proportion of enrollees in the organization who so participate is not significantly disproportionate to the proportion of such enrollees in other such organizations who participate.

      * (iii) The State has provided for an appropriate adjustment in the per capita payments to the organization to account for such participation, taking into account differences in the likely use of health services between enrollees who so participate and enrollees who do not so participate.

* #### (5) Voluntary participation
  * An eligible individual shall be enrolled in a State demonstration program only if the individual voluntarily enrolls. Except in such hardship cases as the Secretary shall specify, such an enrollment shall be effective for a period of 12 months, but may be extended for additional periods of 12 months each with the consent of the individual.

* #### (6) 1-year moratorium for reenrollment

    * (B) contribution into a health opportunity account.


* Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as preventing a State from providing for coverage of preventive care (referred to in subsection (a)(3)) within the alternative benefits without regard to the annual deductible.

* #### (2) Annual deductible
  * The amount of the annual deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100 percent, but no more than 110 percent, of the annualized amount of contributions to the health opportunity account under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), determined without regard to any limitation described in subsection (d)(2)(C)(i)(II).

* #### (3) Access to negotiated provider payment rates
  * #### (A) Fee-for-service enrollees
    * In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and who is not enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall provide that the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from—

      * (ii) any other provider at payment rates that do not exceed 125 percent of the payment rate that would be applicable to such services furnished by a participating provider under this subchapter if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable.

  * #### (B) Treatment under medicaid managed care plans
    * In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and is enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall enter into an arrangement with the organization under which the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from any provider described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) at payment rates that do not exceed the payment rates that may be imposed under that clause.

  * #### (C) Computation

  * #### (D) Definitions
    * For purposes of this paragraph:

    * #### (iii) Budget neutral adjustment
      * A State may provide for dollar limitations in excess of those specified in clause (i)(III) (as increased under clause (ii)) for specified individuals if the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that contributions otherwise made to other individuals will be reduced in a manner so as to provide for aggregate contributions that do not exceed the aggregate contributions that would otherwise be permitted under this subparagraph.
