### §1396r–4. Adjustment in payment for inpatient hospital services furnished by disproportionate share hospitals
#### (a) Implementation of requirement
* (1) A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs), as of July 1, 1988, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary, by not later than such date, an amendment to such plan that—

  * (A) specifically defines the hospitals so described (and includes in such definition any disproportionate share hospital described in subsection (b)(1) which meets the requirements of subsection (d)), and

  * (B) provides, effective for inpatient hospital services provided not later than July 1, 1988, for an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services provided by such hospitals, consistent with subsection (c).


* (2)(A) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsection (c), effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989.

* (B) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1990, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1990, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsections (c) and (f), effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1990.

* (C) If a State plan under this subchapter provides for payments for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise), in order for the plan to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, a State plan amendment that provides, in the case of hospitals defined by the State as disproportionate share hospitals under paragraph (1)(A), for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989, involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay for individuals under one year of age.

* (D) A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirements of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs), as of October 1, 1998, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary by such date a description of the methodology used by the State to identify and to make payments to disproportionate share hospitals, including children's hospitals, on the basis of the proportion of low-income and medicaid patients (including such patients who receive benefits through a managed care entity) served by such hospitals. The State shall provide an annual report to the Secretary describing the disproportionate share payments to each such disproportionate share hospital.

* (3) The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after the date a State submits an amendment under this subsection, review each such amendment for compliance with such requirement and by such date shall approve or disapprove each such amendment. If the Secretary disapproves such an amendment, the State shall immediately submit a revised amendment which meets such requirement.

* (4) The requirement of this subsection may not be waived under section 1396n(b)(4) of this title.

#### (b) Hospitals deemed disproportionate share
* (1) For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a hospital which meets the requirements of subsection (d) is deemed to be a disproportionate share hospital if—

  * (A) the hospital's medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (2)) is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State; or

  * (B) the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (3)) exceeds 25 percent.


* (2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term "medicaid inpatient utilization rate" means, for a hospital, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the hospital's number of inpatient days attributable to patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter in a period (regardless of whether such patients receive medical assistance on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity), and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's inpatient days in that period. In this paragraph, the term "inpatient day" includes each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable placement elsewhere.

* (3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term "low-income utilization rate" means, for a hospital, the sum of—

  * (A) the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—

    * (i) the numerator of which is the sum (for a period) of (I) the total revenues paid the hospital for patient services under a State plan under this subchapter (regardless of whether the services were furnished on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity) and (II) the amount of the cash subsidies for patient services received directly from State and local governments, and

    * (ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the period; and


  * (B) a fraction (expressed as a percentage)—

    * (i) the numerator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services which are attributable to charity care in a period, less the portion of any cash subsidies described in clause (i)(II) of subparagraph (A) in the period reasonably attributable to inpatient hospital services, and

    * (ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services in the hospital in the period.


* The numerator under subparagraph (B)(i) shall not include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter).

* (4) The Secretary may not restrict a State's authority to designate hospitals as disproportionate share hospitals under this section. The previous sentence shall not be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary to reduce payments pursuant to section 1396b(w)(1)(A)(iii) of this title if the Secretary determines that, as a result of such designations, there is in effect a hold harmless provision described in section 1396b(w)(4) of this title.

#### (c) Payment adjustment
* Subject to subsections (f) and (g), in order to be consistent with this subsection, a payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital must either—

  * (1) be in an amount equal to at least the product of (A) the amount paid under the State plan to the hospital for operating costs for inpatient hospital services (of the kind described in section 1395ww(a)(4) of this title), and (B) the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage (established under section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(iv) of this title);

  * (2) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) and (without regard to whether the hospital is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1)) for an increase in such a payment amount (or percentage payment) in proportion to the percentage by which the hospital's medicaid utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2)) exceeds one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State or the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)); or

  * (3) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) that varies according to type of hospital under a methodology that—

    * (A) applies equally to all hospitals of each type; and

    * (B) results in an adjustment for each type of hospital that is reasonably related to the costs, volume, or proportion of services provided to patients eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter or to low-income patients,


* except that, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of subsection (a), the payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital is consistent with this subsection if the appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment is equal to at least one-third of the increase otherwise applicable under this subsection (in the case of such paragraph (1)(B)) and at least two-thirds of such increase (in the case of such paragraph (2)(A)). In the case of a hospital described in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) (relating to children's hospitals), in computing the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the disproportionate patient percentage (defined in section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi) of this title) shall be computed by substituting for the fraction described in subclause (I) of such section the fraction described in subclause (II) of that section. If a State elects in a State plan amendment under subsection (a) to provide the payment adjustment described in paragraph (2), the State must include in the amendment a detailed description of the specific methodology to be used in determining the specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) to be made to each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and must publish at least annually the name of each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and the amount of such payment adjustment made for each such hospital.

#### (d) Requirements to qualify as disproportionate share hospital
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) of this section unless the hospital has at least 2 obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals who are entitled to medical assistance for such services under such State plan.

* (2)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a hospital—

  * (i) the inpatients of which are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age; or

  * (ii) which does not offer nonemergency obstetric services to the general population as of December 22, 1987.


* (B) In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined for purposes of section 1395ww of this title), in paragraph (1) the term "obstetrician" includes any physician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform nonemergency obstetric procedures.

* (3) No hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) or (e) of this section unless the hospital has a medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2)) of not less than 1 percent.

#### (e) Special rule
* (1) A State plan shall be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs) without regard to the requirement of subsection (a) if (A)(i) the plan provided for payment adjustments based on a pooling arrangement involving a majority of the hospitals participating under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals as of January 1, 1984, or (ii) the plan as of January 1, 1987, provided for payment adjustments based on a statewide pooling arrangement involving all acute care hospitals and the arrangement provides for reimbursement of the total amount of uncompensated care provided by each participating hospital, (B) the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for such hospitals is not less than the aggregate amount of such adjustments otherwise required to be made under such subsection, and (C) the plan meets the requirement of subsection (d)(3) and such payment adjustments are made consistent with the last sentence of subsection (c).

* (2) In the case of a State that used a health insuring organization before January 1, 1986, to administer a portion of its plan on a statewide basis, beginning on July 1, 1988—

  * (A) the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) (other than the last sentence of subsection (c)) shall not apply if the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals (as defined under the State plan) is not less than the aggregate amount of payment adjustments otherwise required to be made if such subsections applied,

  * (B) subsection (d)(2)(B) shall apply to hospitals located in urban areas, as well as in rural areas,

  * (C) subsection (d)(3) shall apply, and

  * (D) subsection (g) shall apply.

#### (f) Limitation on Federal financial participation
* #### (1) In general
  * Payment under section 1396b(a) of this title shall not be made to a State with respect to any payment adjustment made under this section for hospitals in a State for quarters in a fiscal year in excess of the disproportionate share hospital (in this subsection referred to as "DSH") allotment for the State for the fiscal year, as specified in paragraphs (2), (3), and (7).

* #### (2) State DSH allotments for fiscal years 1998 through 2002

* #### (3) State DSH allotments for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter
  * #### (A) In general
    * Except as provided in paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) and subparagraph (E), the DSH allotment for any State for fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year is equal to the DSH allotment for the State for the preceding fiscal year under paragraph (2) or this paragraph, increased, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C) and paragraph (5), by the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average), for the previous fiscal year.

  * #### (B) Limitation
    * The DSH allotment for a State shall not be increased under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year to the extent that such an increase would result in the DSH allotment for the year exceeding the greater of—

      * (i) the DSH allotment for the previous year, or

      * (ii) 12 percent of the total amount of expenditures under the State plan for medical assistance during the fiscal year.

  * #### (C) Special, temporary increase in allotments on a one-time, non-cumulative basis
    * The DSH allotment for any State (other than a State with a DSH allotment determined under paragraph (5))—

      * The Secretary shall permit Tennessee to submit an amendment to its State plan under this subchapter that describes the methodology to be used by the State to identify and make payments to disproportionate share hospitals, including children's hospitals and institutions for mental diseases or other mental health facilities. The Secretary may not approve such plan amendment unless the methodology described in the amendment is consistent with the requirements under this section for making payment adjustments to disproportionate share hospitals. For purposes of demonstrating budget neutrality under the TennCare Demonstration Project, payment adjustments made pursuant to a State plan amendment approved in accordance with this subparagraph shall be considered expenditures under such project.

    * #### (iv) Offset of Federal share of payment adjustments for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 and the first calendar quarter of fiscal year 2012 against Essential Access Hospital supplemental pool payments under the TennCare Demonstration Project
      * (I) The total amount of Essential Access Hospital supplemental pool payments that may be made under the TennCare Demonstration Project for fiscal year 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, or for a period in fiscal year 2012 described in clause (i) shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount of any payments made under section 1396b(a) of this title to Tennessee with respect to payment adjustments made under this section for hospitals in the State for such fiscal year or period.

      * (II) The sum of the total amount of payments made under section 1396b(a) of this title to Tennessee with respect to payment adjustments made under this section for hospitals in the State for fiscal year 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, or for a period in fiscal year 2012 described in clause (i) and the total amount of Essential Access Hospital supplemental pool payments made under the TennCare Demonstration Project for such fiscal year or period shall not exceed the State's DSH allotment for such fiscal year or period established under clause (i).

    * #### (v) Allotment for 2d, 3rd, and 4th quarters of fiscal year 2012 and for fiscal year 2013
      * Notwithstanding the table set forth in paragraph (2):

        * In the case of a State that has a DSH allotment of $0 for the 2d, 3rd, and 4th quarters of fiscal year 2012, the DSH allotment shall be $47,200,000 for such quarters.

      * #### (II) Fiscal year 2013
        * In the case of a State that has a DSH allotment of $0 for fiscal year 2013, the DSH allotment shall be $53,100,000 for such fiscal year.

    * #### (vi) Allotment for fiscal years 2015 through 2025

          * (aa) hospitals with high volumes of Medicaid inpatients (as defined in subsection (b)(1)(A)); and

  * #### (A) In general
    * In the case of a hospital with high disproportionate share (as defined in subparagraph (B)), a payment adjustment during a State fiscal year that begins before January 1, 1995, shall be considered consistent with subsection (c) if the payment adjustment does not exceed 200 percent of the costs of furnishing hospital services described in paragraph (1)(A) during the year, but only if the Governor of the State certifies to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the hospital's applicable minimum amount is used for health services during the year. In determining the amount that is used for such services during a year, there shall be excluded any amounts received under the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], subchapter V, subchapter XVIII, or from third party payors (not including the State plan under this subchapter) that are used for providing such services during the year.

  * #### (B) Applicable percentage of 1995 total DSH payment allotment
    * The amount of such payment adjustments which are equal to the applicable percentage of the Federal share of payment adjustments made to hospitals in the State under subsection (c) that are attributable to the 1995 DSH allotment for the State for payments to institutions for mental diseases and other mental health facilities (based on reporting data specified by the State on HCFA Form 64 as mental health DSH, and as approved by the Secretary).
