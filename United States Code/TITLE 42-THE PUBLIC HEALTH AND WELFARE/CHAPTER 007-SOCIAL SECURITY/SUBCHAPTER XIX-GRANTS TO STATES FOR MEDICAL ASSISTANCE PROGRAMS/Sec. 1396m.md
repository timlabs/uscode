#### (b) Reductions in payments to and by States
* The Secretary may (subject to the remaining provisions of this section) reduce payment to a State under this subchapter for any quarter by an amount equal to the lesser of the Federal matching share of payments to any institution or person specified in subsection (a), or the total overpayments to such institution or person under subchapter XVIII, and may require the State to reduce its payment to such institution or person by such amount.

#### (c) Notice

#### (d) Regulations
* The Secretary shall by regulation provide procedures for implementation of this section, which procedures shall (1) determine the amount of the Federal payment to which the institution or person would otherwise be entitled under this section which shall be treated as a setoff against overpayments under subchapter XVIII, and (2) assure the restoration to the institution or person of amounts withheld under this section which are ultimately determined to be in excess of overpayments under subchapter XVIII and to which the institution or person would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter.
