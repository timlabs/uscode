### §1396r–8. Payment for covered outpatient drugs
#### (a) Requirement for rebate agreement
* #### (1) In general
  * In order for payment to be available under section 1396b(a) of this title or under part B of subchapter XVIII for covered outpatient drugs of a manufacturer, the manufacturer must have entered into and have in effect a rebate agreement described in subsection (b) with the Secretary, on behalf of States (except that, the Secretary may authorize a State to enter directly into agreements with a manufacturer), and must meet the requirements of paragraph (5) (with respect to drugs purchased by a covered entity on or after the first day of the first month that begins after November 4, 1992) and paragraph (6). Any agreement between a State and a manufacturer prior to April 1, 1991, shall be deemed to have been entered into on January 1, 1991, and payment to such manufacturer shall be retroactively calculated as if the agreement between the manufacturer and the State had been entered into on January 1, 1991. If a manufacturer has not entered into such an agreement before March 1, 1991, such an agreement, subsequently entered into, shall become effective as of the date on which the agreement is entered into or, at State option, on any date thereafter on or before the first day of the calendar quarter that begins more than 60 days after the date the agreement is entered into.

* #### (2) Effective date
  * Paragraph (1) shall first apply to drugs dispensed under this subchapter on or after January 1, 1991.

  * Paragraph (1), and section 1396b(i)(10)(A) of this title, shall not apply to the dispensing of a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug if (A)(i) the State has made a determination that the availability of the drug is essential to the health of beneficiaries under the State plan for medical assistance; (ii) such drug has been given a rating of 1–A by the Food and Drug Administration; and (iii)(I) the physician has obtained approval for use of the drug in advance of its dispensing in accordance with a prior authorization program described in subsection (d), or (II) the Secretary has reviewed and approved the State's determination under subparagraph (A); or (B) the Secretary determines that in the first calendar quarter of 1991, there were extenuating circumstances.

* #### (4) Effect on existing agreements
  * In the case of a rebate agreement in effect between a State and a manufacturer on November 5, 1990, such agreement, for the initial agreement period specified therein, shall be considered to be a rebate agreement in compliance with this section with respect to that State, if the State agrees to report to the Secretary any rebates paid pursuant to the agreement and such agreement provides for a minimum aggregate rebate of 10 percent of the State's total expenditures under the State plan for coverage of the manufacturer's drugs under this subchapter. If, after the initial agreement period, the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an agreement in effect on November 5, 1990, provides for rebates that are at least as large as the rebates otherwise required under this section, and the State agrees to report any rebates under the agreement to the Secretary, the agreement shall be considered to be a rebate agreement in compliance with the section for the renewal periods of such agreement.

    * #### (ii) State agency
      * Each such single State agency shall provide a means by which a covered entity shall indicate on any drug reimbursement claims form (or format, where electronic claims management is used) that a unit of the drug that is the subject of the form is subject to an agreement under section 256b of this title, and not submit to any manufacturer a claim for a rebate payment under subsection (b) with respect to such a drug.

  * #### (D) Effect of subsequent amendments
    * In determining whether an agreement under subparagraph (A) meets the requirements of section 256b of this title, the Secretary shall not take into account any amendments to such section that are enacted after November 4, 1992.

#### (b) Terms of rebate agreement
* #### (1) Periodic rebates
  * #### (A) In general
    * A rebate agreement under this subsection shall require the manufacturer to provide, to each State plan approved under this subchapter, a rebate for a rebate period in an amount specified in subsection (c) for covered outpatient drugs of the manufacturer dispensed after December 31, 1990, for which payment was made under the State plan for such period, including such drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled with a medicaid managed care organization if the organization is responsible for coverage of such drugs.

    * #### (i) In general
      * In addition to the amounts applied as a reduction under subparagraph (B), for rebate periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, during a fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce payments to a State under section 1396b(a) of this title in the manner specified in clause (ii), in an amount equal to the product of—

        * (II) the amounts received by the State under such subparagraph that are attributable (as estimated by the Secretary based on utilization and other data) to the increase in the minimum rebate percentage effected by the amendments made by subsections (a)(1), (b), and (d) of section 2501 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, taking into account the additional drugs included under the amendments made by subsection (c) of section 2501 of such Act.


  * &nbsp;The Secretary shall adjust such payment reduction for a calendar quarter to the extent the Secretary determines, based upon subsequent utilization and other data, that the reduction for such quarter was greater or less than the amount of payment reduction that should have been made.

    * #### (ii) Manner of payment reduction
      * The amount of the payment reduction under clause (i) for a State for a quarter shall be deemed an overpayment to the State under this subchapter to be disallowed against the State's regular quarterly draw for all Medicaid spending under section 1396b(d)(2) of this title. Such a disallowance is not subject to a reconsideration under section 1316(d) of this title.

* #### (2) State provision of information
