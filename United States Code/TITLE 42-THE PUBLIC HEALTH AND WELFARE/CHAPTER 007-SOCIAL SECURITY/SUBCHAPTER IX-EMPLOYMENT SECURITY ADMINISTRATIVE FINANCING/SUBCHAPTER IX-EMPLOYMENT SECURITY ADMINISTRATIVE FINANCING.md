#### (b) Amount credited to Account; transfer of funds; adjustments; repayment of internal revenue refunds
* (1) There is hereby appropriated to the Unemployment Trust Fund for credit to the employment security administration account, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1961, and for each fiscal year thereafter, an amount equal to 100 per centum of the tax (including interest, penalties, and additions to the tax) received during the fiscal year under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] and covered into the Treasury.

* (2) The amount appropriated by paragraph (1) shall be transferred at least monthly from the general fund of the Treasury to the Unemployment Trust Fund and credited to the employment security administration account. Each such transfer shall be based on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts received in the Treasury. Proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred, to the extent prior estimates (including estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960) were in excess of or were less than the amounts required to be transferred.

* (3) The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to pay from time to time from the employment security administration account into the Treasury, as repayments to the account for refunding internal revenue collections, amounts equal to all refunds made after June 30, 1960, of amounts received as tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] (including interest on such refunds).

#### (c) Administrative expenditures; necessary expenses; quarterly transfer of funds; adjustments; limitation; estimate of net receipts

    * (ii) the establishment and maintenance of systems of public employment offices in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933, as amended (29 U.S.C., secs. 49–49n), and

    * (iii) carrying into effect section 4103 of title 38;


  * (B) such amounts (not in excess of the limit provided by paragraph (4) with respect to clause (iii)) as the Congress may deem appropriate for the necessary expenses of the Department of Labor for the performance of its functions under—

    * (iv) chapter 41 (except section 4103) of title 38, and

    * (v) any Federal unemployment compensation law.


* The term "necessary expenses" as used in this subparagraph (B) shall include the expense of reimbursing a State for salaries and other expenses of employees of such State temporarily assigned or detailed to duty with the Department of Labor and of paying such employees for travel expenses, transportation of household goods, and per diem in lieu of subsistence while away from their regular duty stations in the State, at rates authorized by law for civilian employees of the Federal Government.

* (2) The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to pay from the employment security administration account into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts the amount estimated by him which will be expended during a three-month period by the Treasury Department for the performance of its functions under—

  * (B) the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.], and

  * (C) any Federal unemployment compensation law with respect to which responsibility for administration is vested in the Secretary of Labor.


* If it subsequently appears that the estimates under this paragraph in any particular period were too high or too low, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in future payments.

* (3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the limitation on the amount authorized to be made available for any fiscal year after June 30, 1970, is, except as provided in subparagraph (B) and in the second sentence of subsection (f)(3)(A), an amount equal to 95 percent of the amount estimated and set forth in the budget of the United States Government for such fiscal year as the amount by which the net receipts during such year under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] will exceed the amount transferred under section 1105(b) of this title during such year to the extended unemployment compensation account.

* (B) The limitation established by subparagraph (A) is increased by any unexpended amount retained in the employment security administration account in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(B).

* (C) Each estimate of net receipts under this paragraph shall be based upon a tax rate of 0.6 percent.

* (4) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(ii) and (1)(B)(iii) the amount authorized to be made available out of the employment security administration account for any fiscal year after June 30, 1972, shall reflect the proportion of the total cost of administering the system of public employment offices in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933, as amended [29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.], and of the necessary expenses of the Department of Labor for the performance of its functions under the provisions of such Act, as the President determines is an appropriate charge to the employment security administration account, and reflects in his annual budget for such year. The President's determination, after consultation with the Secretary, shall take into account such factors as the relationship between employment subject to State laws and the total labor force in the United States, the number of claimants and the number of job applicants, and such other factors as he finds relevant.

    * (i) 100 per centum of the additional tax received under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] with respect to any State by reason of the reduced credits provisions of section 3302(c)(3) of such Act [26 U.S.C. 3302(c)(3)] and covered into the Treasury for the repayment of advances made to the State under section 1321 of this title, exceeds

    * (ii) the amount transferred to the account of such State pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.


* Any amount transferred pursuant to this subparagraph shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, that balance of advances, made under section 1321 of this title to the State, with respect to which employers paid such additional tax.

  * (B) To the account (in the Unemployment Trust Fund) of the State with respect to which employers paid such additional tax, an amount equal to the amount by which such additional tax received and covered into the Treasury exceeds that balance of advances, made under section 1321 of this title to the State, with respect to which employers paid such additional tax.


* (2) Transfers under this subsection shall be as of the beginning of the month succeeding the month in which the moneys were credited to the employment security administration account pursuant to subsection (b)(2).

#### (e) Revolving fund; appropriations; advances to Account; repayment; interest
* (1) There is hereby established in the Treasury a revolving fund which shall be available to make the advances authorized by this subsection. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitation, to such revolving fund such amounts as may be necessary for the purposes of this section.

* (2) The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to advance from time to time from the revolving fund to the employment security administration account such amounts as may be necessary for the purposes of this section. If the net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year equals 40 percent of the amount of the total appropriation by the Congress out of the employment security administration account for the preceding fiscal year, no advance may be made under this subsection during such fiscal year.

* (3) Advances to the employment security administration account made under this subsection shall bear interest until repaid at a rate equal to the average rate of interest (computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such advance) borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.

* (4) Advances to the employment security administration account made under this subsection, plus interest accrued thereon, shall be repaid by the transfer from time to time, from the employment security administration account to the revolving fund, of such amounts as the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines to be available in the employment security administration account for such repayment. Any amount transferred as a repayment under this paragraph shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, any balance of advances (plus accrued interest) repayable under this subsection.

#### (f) Determination of excess in Account; limitation on amount to be retained; use of balance in Account during certain fiscal years; net balance
* (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine as of the close of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1961) the excess in the employment security administration account.

* (2) The excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year is the amount by which the net balance in such account as of such time (after the application of section 1102(b) of this title and paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection) exceeds the net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of that fiscal year (including the fiscal year for which the excess is being computed) for which the net balance was higher than as of the beginning of any other such fiscal year.

* (3)(A) The excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972, shall be retained (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) in the employment security administration account until the amount in such account is equal to 40 percent of the amount of the total appropriation by the Congress out of the employment security administration account for the fiscal year for which the excess is determined. Three-eighths of the amount in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972, or $150 million, whichever is the lesser, is authorized to be made available for such fiscal year pursuant to subsection (c)(1) for additional costs of administration due to an increase in the rate of insured unemployment for a calendar quarter of at least 15 percent over the rate of insured unemployment for the corresponding calendar quarter in the immediately preceding year.

* (B) If the entire amount of the excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972, is not retained in the employment security administration account, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the extended unemployment compensation account the balance of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account to the limit provided in section 1105(b)(2) of this title.

* (C) If as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972, the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account exceeds the limit provided in section 1105(b)(2) of this title, such excess shall be transferred to the employment security administration account as of the close of such fiscal year.

* (4) For the purposes of this section, the net balance in the employment security administration account as of any time is the amount in such account as of such time reduced by the sum of—

  * (A) the amounts then subject to transfer pursuant to subsection (d), and

  * (B) the balance of advances (plus interest accrued thereon) then repayable to the revolving fund established by subsection (e).


* The net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year shall be determined after the disposition of the excess in such account as of the close of the preceding fiscal year.

### §1102. Transfers between Federal unemployment account and employment security administration account
#### (a) Determination of excess; amount transferred
* Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury determines pursuant to section 1101(f) of this title that there is an excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year and the entire amount of such excess is not retained in the employment security administration account or transferred to the extended unemployment compensation account as provided in section 1101(f)(3) of this title, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the Federal unemployment account the balance of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the Federal unemployment account to whichever of the following is the greater:

  * (1) $550 million, or

  * (2) the amount (determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury) equal to 0.5 percent of the total wages subject (determined without any limitation on amount) to contributions under all State unemployment compensation laws for the calendar year ending during the fiscal year for which the excess is determined.

#### (b) Unemployment account excesses
* The amount, if any, by which the amount in the Federal unemployment account as of the close of any fiscal year exceeds the greater of the amounts specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) shall be transferred to the employment security administration account as of the close of such fiscal year.

#### (c) Report to Congress
* Whenever the Secretary of Labor has reason to believe that in the next fiscal year the employment security administration account will reach the limit provided for such account in section 1101(f)(3)(A) of this title, and the Federal unemployment account will reach the limit provided for such account in subsection (a), and the extended unemployment compensation account will reach the limit provided for such account in section 1105(b)(2) of this title, he shall, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, so report to the Congress with a recommendation for appropriate action by the Congress.

### §1103. Amounts transferred to State accounts
#### (a) Determination and certification by Secretary of Labor
* (1) If as of the close of any fiscal year after the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account has reached the limit provided in section 1105(b)(2) of this title and the amount in the Federal unemployment account has reached the limit provided in section 1102(a) of this title and all advances and interest pursuant to section 1105(d) of this title and section 1323 of this title have been repaid, and there remains in the employment security administration account any amount over the amount provided in section 1101(f)(3)(A) of this title, such excess amount, except as provided in subsection (b), shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund.

* (2) Each State's share of the funds to be transferred under this subsection as of any October 1—

  * (A) shall be determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by such Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury before such date, and

  * (B) shall bear the same ratio to the total amount to be so transferred as—

    * (i) the amount of wages subject to tax under section 3301 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the preceding calendar year which are determined by the Secretary of Labor to be attributable to the State, bears to

    * (ii) the total amount of wages subject to such tax during such year.

#### (b) Transfer of funds where State is ineligible
* (1) If the Secretary of Labor finds that on October 1 of any fiscal year—

  * (A) a State is not eligible for certification under section 503 of this title, or

  * (B) the law of a State is not approvable under section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3304],


* then the amount available for transfer to such State's account shall, in lieu of being so transferred, be transferred to the Federal unemployment account as of the beginning of such October 1. If, during the fiscal year beginning on such October 1, the Secretary of Labor finds and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that such State is eligible for certification under section 503 of this title, that the law of such State is approvable under such section 3304, or both, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer such amount from the Federal unemployment account to the account of such State. If the Secretary of Labor does not so find and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury before the close of such fiscal year then the amount which was available for transfer to such State's account as of October 1 of such fiscal year shall (as of the close of such fiscal year) become unrestricted as to use as part of the Federal unemployment account.

* (2) The amount which, but for this paragraph, would be transferred to the account of a State under subsection (a) or paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the balance of advances made to the State under section 1321 of this title. The sum by which such amount is reduced shall—

  * (A) be transferred to or retained in (as the case may be) the Federal unemployment account, and

  * (B) be credited against, and operate to reduce—

    * (i) first, any balance of advances made before September 13, 1960, to the State under section 1321 of this title, and

    * (ii) second, any balance of advances made on or after September 13, 1960, to the State under section 1321 of this title.

#### (c) Use of funds
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), amounts transferred to the account of a State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) shall be used only in the payment of cash benefits to individuals with respect to their unemployment, exclusive of expenses of administration.

* (2) A State may, pursuant to a specific appropriation made by the legislative body of the State, use money withdrawn from its account in the payment of expenses incurred by it for the administration of its unemployment compensation law and public employment offices if and only if—

  * (A) the purposes and amounts were specified in the law making the appropriation,

  * (B) the appropriation law did not authorize the obligation of such money after the close of the two-year period which began on the date of enactment of the appropriation law,

  * (C) the money is withdrawn and the expenses are incurred after such date of enactment,

  * (D)(i) the appropriation law limits the total amount which may be obligated under such appropriation at any time to an amount which does not exceed, at any such time, the amount by which—

    * (I) the aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of such State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), exceeds

    * (II) the aggregate of the amounts used by the State pursuant to this subsection and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of such State, and


  * (ii) for purposes of clause (i), amounts used by a State for administration shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into, and

  * (E) the use of the money is accounted for in accordance with standards established by the Secretary of Labor.


* (3)(A) If—

  * (i) amounts transferred to the account of a State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section were used in payment of unemployment benefits to individuals; and

  * (ii) the Governor of such State submits a request to the Secretary of Labor that such amounts be restored under this paragraph,


* then the amounts described in clause (i) shall be restored to the status of funds transferred under subsections (a) and (b) of this section which have not been used by eliminating any charge against amounts so transferred for the use of such amounts in the payment of unemployment benefits.

* (B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only to the extent that the amounts described in clause (i) of such subparagraph do not exceed the amount then in the State's account.

* (C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the State has a balance of advances made to its account under subchapter XII of this chapter.

* (D) If the Secretary of Labor determines that the requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any request, the Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State that such requirements are met with respect to such request and the amount restored under this paragraph. Such restoration shall be as of the first day of the first month following the month in which the notification is made.

#### (d) Special transfer in fiscal year 2002
* (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer (as of the date determined under paragraph (5)) from the Federal unemployment account to the account of each State in the Unemployment Trust Fund the amount determined with respect to such State under paragraph (2).

* (2)(A) The amount to be transferred under this subsection to a State account shall (as determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by such Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury) be equal to—

  * (i) the amount which would have been required to have been transferred under this section to such account at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 if—

    * (I) section 209(a)(1) of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 had been enacted before the close of fiscal year 2001, and

    * (II) section 5402 of Public Law 105–33 (relating to increase in Federal unemployment account ceiling) had not been enacted,

  * (ii) the amount which was in fact transferred under this section to such account at the beginning of fiscal year 2002.


* (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A)—

  * (i) the aggregate amount transferred to the States under this subsection may not exceed a total of $8,000,000,000; and

  * (ii) all amounts determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced ratably, if and to the extent necessary in order to comply with the limitation under clause (i).


* (3)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (4), amounts transferred to a State account pursuant to this subsection may be used only in the payment of cash benefits—

  * (ii) which are allowable under subparagraph (B) or (C).


* (B)(i) At the option of the State, cash benefits under this paragraph may include amounts which shall be payable as—

  * (I) regular compensation, or

  * (II) additional compensation, upon the exhaustion of any temporary extended unemployment compensation (if such State has entered into an agreement under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002), for individuals eligible for regular compensation under the unemployment compensation law of such State.


* (ii) Any additional compensation under clause (i) may not be taken into account for purposes of any determination relating to the amount of any extended compensation for which an individual might be eligible.

* (B) The maximum incentive payment allowable under this subsection with respect to any State shall, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, be equal to the amount obtained by multiplying $7,000,000,000 by the same ratio as would apply under subsection (a)(2)(B) for purposes of determining such State's share of any excess amount (as described in subsection (a)(1)) that would have been subject to transfer to State accounts, as of October 1, 2008, under the provisions of subsection (a).

  * (ii) the remainder shall be transferred to the account of such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (3).


* (2) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law—

  * (A) uses a base period that includes the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment compensation; or

  * (B) provides that, in the case of an individual who would not otherwise be eligible for unemployment compensation under the State law because of the use of a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year, eligibility shall be determined using a base period that includes such calendar quarter.


* (3) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law includes provisions to carry out at least 2 of the following subparagraphs:

  * (A) An individual shall not be denied regular unemployment compensation under any State law provisions relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work, solely because such individual is seeking only part-time work (as defined by the Secretary of Labor), except that the State law provisions carrying out this subparagraph may exclude an individual if a majority of the weeks of work in such individual's base period do not include part-time work (as so defined).

  * (B) An individual shall not be disqualified from regular unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that separation is for any compelling family reason. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "compelling family reason" means the following:

    * (i) One or both of the following offenses as selected by the State, but in making such selection, the resulting change in the State law shall not supercede any other provision of law relating to unemployment insurance to the extent that such other provision provides broader access to unemployment benefits for victims of such selected offense or offenses:

      * (I) Domestic violence, verified by such reasonable and confidential documentation as the State law may require, which causes the individual reasonably to believe that such individual's continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any member of the individual's immediate family (as defined by the Secretary of Labor); and

      * (II) Sexual assault, verified by such reasonable and confidential documentation as the State law may require, which causes the individual reasonably to believe that such individual's continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any member of the individual's immediate family (as defined by the Secretary of Labor).


    * (ii) The illness or disability of a member of the individual's immediate family (as those terms are defined by the Secretary of Labor).

    * (iii) The need for the individual to accompany such individual's spouse—

      * (I) to a place from which it is impractical for such individual to commute; and

      * (II) due to a change in location of the spouse's employment.


  * (C)(i) Weekly unemployment compensation is payable under this subparagraph to any individual who is unemployed (as determined under the State unemployment compensation law), has exhausted all rights to regular unemployment compensation under the State law, and is enrolled and making satisfactory progress in a State-approved training program or in a job training program authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, except that such compensation is not required to be paid to an individual who is receiving similar stipends or other training allowances for non-training costs.

  * (ii) Each State-approved training program or job training program referred to in clause (i) shall prepare individuals who have been separated from a declining occupation, or who have been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the individual's place of employment, for entry into a high-demand occupation.

  * (iii) The amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to an individual for a week of unemployment shall be equal to—

    * (I) the individual's average weekly benefit amount (including dependents' allowances) for the most recent benefit year, less

    * (II) any deductible income, as determined under State law.


* The total amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to any individual shall be equal to at least 26 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount (including dependents' allowances) for the most recent benefit year.

  * (D) Dependents' allowances are provided, in the case of any individual who is entitled to receive regular unemployment compensation and who has any dependents (as defined by State law), in an amount equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, subject to any aggregate limitation on such allowances which the State law may establish (but which aggregate limitation on the total allowance for dependents paid to an individual may not be less than $50 for each week of unemployment or 50 percent of the individual's weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, whichever is less), except that a State law may provide for a reasonable reduction in the amount of any such allowance for a week of less than total unemployment.


* (4)(A) Any State seeking an incentive payment under this subsection shall submit an application therefor at such time, in such manner, and complete with such information as the Secretary of Labor may within 60 days after February 17, 2009, prescribe (whether by regulation or otherwise), including information relating to compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as well as how the State intends to use the incentive payment to improve or strengthen the State's unemployment compensation program.

### §1104. Unemployment Trust Fund
#### (a) Establishment
* There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the "Unemployment Trust Fund", hereinafter in this subchapter called the "Fund". The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive and hold in the Fund all moneys deposited therein by a State agency from a State unemployment fund, or by the Railroad Retirement Board to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account or the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund, or otherwise deposited in or credited to the Fund or any account therein. Such deposit may be made directly with the Secretary of the Treasury, with any depositary designated by him for such purpose, or with any Federal Reserve Bank.

#### (b) Investments
* It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. Obligations other than such special obligations may be acquired for the Fund only on such terms as to provide an investment yield not less than the yield which would be required in the case of special obligations if issued to the Fund upon the date of such acquisition. Advances made to the Federal unemployment account pursuant to section 1323 of this title shall not be invested.

#### (c) Sale or redemption of obligations
* Any obligations acquired by the Fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund) may be sold at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.

#### (d) Treatment of interest and proceeds
* The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.

#### (e) Separate book accounts
* The Fund shall be invested as a single fund, but the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain a separate book account for each State agency, the employment security administration account, the Federal unemployment account, the railroad unemployment insurance account, and the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund and shall credit quarterly (on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year) to each account, on the basis of the average daily balance of such account, a proportionate part of the earnings of the Fund for the quarter ending on such date. For the purpose of this subsection, the average daily balance shall be computed—

  * (1) in the case of any State account, by reducing (but not below zero) the amount in the account by the balance of advances made to the State under section 1321 of this title, and

  * (2) in the case of the Federal unemployment account—

    * (A) by adding to the amount in the account the aggregate of the reductions under paragraph (1), and

    * (B) by subtracting from the sum so obtained the balance of advances made under section 1323 of this title to the account.

#### (f) Payment to State agencies and Railroad Retirement Board
* The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay out of the Fund to any State agency such amount as it may duly requisition, not exceeding the amount standing to the account of such State agency at the time of such payment. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make such payments out of the railroad unemployment insurance account for the payment of benefits, and out of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund for the payment of administrative expenses, as the Railroad Retirement Board may duly certify, not exceeding the amount standing to the credit of such account or such fund, as the case may be, at the time of such payment.

#### (g) Federal unemployment account; establishment
* There is hereby established in the Unemployment Trust Fund a Federal unemployment account.

### §1105. Extended unemployment compensation account
#### (a) Establishment
* There is hereby established in the Unemployment Trust Fund an extended unemployment compensation account. For the purposes provided for in section 1104(e) of this title, such account shall be maintained as a separate book account.

#### (b) Transfers to account
* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer (as of the close of each month) from the employment security administration account to the extended unemployment compensation account established by subsection (a), an amount (determined by such Secretary) equal to 20 percent of the amount by which—

  * (A) the transfers to the employment security administration account pursuant to section 1101(b)(2) of this title during such month, exceed

  * (B) the payments during such month from the employment security administration account pursuant to section 1101(b)(3) and (d) of this title.


* If for any such month the payments referred to in subparagraph (B) exceed the transfers referred to in subparagraph (A), proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred.

* (2) Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury determines pursuant to section 1101(f) of this title that there is an excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year beginning after June 30, 1972, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the extended unemployment compensation account the total amount of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account to whichever of the following is the greater:

  * (A) $750,000,000, or

  * (B) the amount (determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury) equal to 0.5 percent of the total wages subject (determined without any limitation on amount) to contributions under all State unemployment compensation laws for the calendar year ending during the fiscal year for which the excess is determined.


* (3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall make no transfer pursuant to paragraph (1) as of the close of any month if he determines that the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account is equal to (or in excess of) the limitation provided in paragraph (2).

#### (c) Transfers to State accounts
* Amounts in the extended unemployment compensation account shall be available for transfer to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund as provided in section 204(e) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.

#### (d) Advances to account; repayment
* There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitation, to the extended unemployment compensation account, as repayable advances, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances shall be repaid by transfers from the extended unemployment compensation account to the general fund of the Treasury, at such times as the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to be adequate for such purpose. Repayments under the preceding sentence shall be made whenever the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the Secretary of Labor) determines that the amount then in the account exceeds the amount necessary to meet the anticipated payments from the account during the next 3 months. Any amount transferred as a repayment under this subsection shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, any balance of advances repayable under this subsection. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances for purposes of this subsection shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such advance, borne by all interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that in cases in which such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent next lower than such average rate.

### §1106. Unemployment compensation research program
* (a) The Secretary of Labor shall—

  * (1) establish a continuing and comprehensive program of research to evaluate the unemployment compensation system. Such research shall include, but not be limited to, a program of factual studies covering the role of unemployment compensation under varying patterns of unemployment including those in seasonal industries, the relationship between the unemployment compensation and other social insurance programs, the effect of State eligibility and disqualification provisions, the personal characteristics, family situations, employment background and experience of claimants, with the results of such studies to be made public; and

  * (2) establish a program of research to develop information (which shall be made public) as to the effect and impact of extending coverage to excluded groups with first attention to agricultural labor.


* (b) To assist in the establishment and provide for the continuation of the comprehensive research program relating to the unemployment compensation system, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, and for each fiscal year thereafter, such sums, not to exceed $8,000,000, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. From the sums authorized to be appropriated by this subsection the Secretary may provide for the conduct of such research through grants or contracts.

### §1107. Personnel training
#### (a) Creation of program
* In order to assist in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of administration of the unemployment compensation program by increasing the number of adequately trained personnel, the Secretary of Labor shall—

  * (1) provide directly, through State agencies, or through contracts with institutions of higher education or other qualified agencies, organizations, or institutions, programs and courses designed to train individuals to prepare them, or improve their qualifications, for service in the administration of the unemployment compensation program, including claims determinations and adjudication, with such stipends and allowances as may be permitted under regulations of the Secretary;

  * (2) develop training materials for and provide technical assistance to the State agencies in the operation of their training programs;
