* An individual may enroll in the insurance program established by this part only in such manner and form as may be prescribed by regulations, and only during an enrollment period prescribed in or under this section.

#### (b) Repealed. Pub. L. 96–499, title IX, §945(a), Dec. 5, 1980, 94 Stat. 2642
#### (c) Initial general enrollment period; eligible individuals before March 1, 1966
* In the case of individuals who first satisfy paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1395o(a) of this title before March 1, 1966, the initial general enrollment period shall begin on the first day of the second month which begins after July 30, 1965, and shall end on May 31, 1966. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (d), an individual who has attained age 65 and who satisfies paragraph (1) of section 1395o(a) of this title but not paragraph (2) of such section shall be treated as satisfying such paragraph (1) on the first day on which he is (or on filing application would have been) entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A.

Where the Secretary finds that an individual who has attained age 65 failed to enroll under this part during his initial enrollment period (based on a determination by the Secretary of the month in which such individual attained age 65), because such individual (relying on documentary evidence) was mistaken as to his correct date of birth, the Secretary shall establish for such individual an initial enrollment period based on his attaining age 65 at the time shown in such documentary evidence (with a coverage period determined under section 1395q of this title as though he had attained such age at that time).

#### (e) General enrollment period
* There shall be a general enrollment period during the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31 of each year.

#### (f) Individuals deemed enrolled in medical insurance program
* Any individual—

  * (1) who is eligible under section 1395o(a) of this title to enroll in the medical insurance program by reason of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits as described in paragraph (1) of such section, and

  * (2) whose initial enrollment period under subsection (d) begins after March 31, 1973, and

  * (B) in the case of an individual who is not entitled to benefits under section 402 of this title on the first day of his initial enrollment period and does not become so entitled during the first 3 months of such period, his enrollment shall be deemed to have occurred in the month in which he files the application establishing his entitlement to hospital insurance benefits provided such filing occurs during the last 4 months of his initial enrollment period; and

  * (3) in the case of an individual who would otherwise satisfy subsection (f) but does not establish his entitlement to hospital insurance benefits until after the last day of his initial enrollment period (as defined in subsection (d) of this section), his enrollment shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day of the earlier of the then current or immediately succeeding general enrollment period (as defined in subsection (e) of this section).

#### (h) Waiver of enrollment period requirements where individual's rights were prejudiced by administrative error or inaction
* In any case where the Secretary finds that an individual's enrollment or nonenrollment in the insurance program established by this part or part A pursuant to section 1395i–2 of this title is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous and is the result of the error, misrepresentation, or inaction of an officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government, or its instrumentalities, the Secretary may take such action (including the designation for such individual of a special initial or subsequent enrollment period, with a coverage period determined on the basis thereof and with appropriate adjustments of premiums) as may be necessary to correct or eliminate the effects of such error, misrepresentation, or inaction.
