In the previous sentence, the term "team" refers to a physician and includes a physician assistant acting under the supervision of the physician or a nurse practitioner working in collaboration with that physician, or both.

* (3) The Secretary—

  * (A) shall take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a cost basis, the cost is reasonable cost (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title);

  * (B) shall take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a charge basis, such charge will be reasonable and not higher than the charge applicable, for a comparable service and under comparable circumstances, to the policyholders and subscribers of the medicare administrative contractor, and such payment will (except as otherwise provided in section 1395gg(f) of this title) be made—

    * (i) on the basis of an itemized bill; or

    * (ii) on the basis of an assignment under the terms of which (I) the reasonable charge is the full charge for the service, (II) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for services for which payment under this subchapter is denied under section 1320c–3(a)(2) of this title by reason of a determination under section 1320c–3(a)(1)(B) of this title, and (III) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for such service if payment may not be made therefor by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 1395y(a) of this title, and if the individual to whom such service was furnished was without fault in incurring the expenses of such service, and if the Secretary's determination that payment (pursuant to such assignment) was incorrect and was made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice of such payment was sent to such individual; except that the Secretary may reduce such three-year period to not less than one year if he finds such reduction is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter (except in the case of physicians' services and ambulance service furnished as described in section 1395y(a)(4) of this title, other than for purposes of section 1395gg(f) of this title);


* but (in the case of bills submitted, or requests for payment made, after March 1968) only if the bill is submitted, or a written request for payment is made in such other form as may be permitted under regulations, no later than the period ending 1 calendar year after the date of service;

  * (C) to (E) Repealed. Pub. L. 108–173, title IX, §911(c)(3)(C)(iv), Dec. 8, 2003, 117 Stat. 2384;

  * (F) shall take such action as may be necessary to assure that where payment under this part for a service rendered is on a charge basis, such payment shall be determined on the basis of the charge that is determined in accordance with this section on the basis of customary and prevailing charge levels in effect at the time the service was rendered or, in the case of services rendered more than 12 months before the year in which the bill is submitted or request for payment is made, on the basis of such levels in effect for the 12-month period preceding such year;

  * (G) shall, for a service that is furnished with respect to an individual enrolled under this part, that is not paid on an assignment-related basis, and that is subject to a limiting charge under section 1395w–4(g) of this title—

    * (i) determine, prior to making payment, whether the amount billed for such service exceeds the limiting charge applicable under section 1395w–4(g)(2) of this title;

    * (ii) notify the physician, supplier, or other person periodically (but not less often than once every 30 days) of determinations that amounts billed exceeded such applicable limiting charges; and

    * (iii) provide for prompt response to inquiries of physicians, suppliers, and other persons concerning the accuracy of such limiting charges for their services;


  * (H) shall implement—

    * (i) programs to recruit and retain physicians as participating physicians in the area served by the medicare administrative contractor, including educational and outreach activities and the use of professional relations personnel to handle billing and other problems relating to payment of claims of participating physicians; and

    * (ii) programs to familiarize beneficiaries with the participating physician program and to assist such beneficiaries in locating participating physicians;


  * (I) Repealed. Pub. L. 108–173, title IX, §911(c)(3)(C)(vi), Dec. 8, 2003, 117 Stat. 2384;

  * (J), (K) Repealed. Pub. L. 101–234, title II, §201(a), Dec. 13, 1989, 103 Stat. 1981;

  * (L) shall monitor and profile physicians' billing patterns within each area or locality and provide comparative data to physicians whose utilization patterns vary significantly from other physicians in the same payment area or locality.


* In determining the reasonable charge for services for purposes of this paragraph, there shall be taken into consideration the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person furnishing such services, as well as the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services. No charge may be determined to be reasonable in the case of bills submitted or requests for payment made under this part after December 31, 1970, if it exceeds the higher of (i) the prevailing charge recognized by the carrier and found acceptable by the Secretary for similar services in the same locality in administering this part on December 31, 1970, or (ii) the prevailing charge level that, on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Secretary, would cover 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 last preceding the start of the calendar year in which the service is rendered. In the case of physicians' services the prevailing charge level determined for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence for any twelve-month period (beginning after June 30, 1973) specified in clause (ii) of such sentence may not exceed (in the aggregate) the level determined under such clause for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, or (with respect to physicians' services furnished in a year after 1987) the level determined under this sentence (or under any other provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level) for the previous year except to the extent that the Secretary finds, on the basis of appropriate economic index data, that such higher level is justified by year-to-year economic changes. With respect to power-operated wheelchairs for which payment may be made in accordance with section 1395x(s)(6) of this title, charges determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge at which power-operated wheelchairs are available in the locality. In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment (including equipment servicing) that, in the judgment of the Secretary, do not generally vary significantly in quality from one supplier to another, the charges incurred after December 31, 1972, determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which such services, supplies, and equipment are widely and consistently available in a locality except to the extent and under the circumstances specified by the Secretary. The requirement in subparagraph (B) that a bill be submitted or request for payment be made by the close of the following calendar year shall not apply if (I) failure to submit the bill or request the payment by the close of such year is due to the error or misrepresentation of an officer, employee, fiscal intermediary, carrier, medicare administrative contractor, or agent of the Department of Health and Human Services performing functions under this subchapter and acting within the scope of his or its authority, and (II) the bill is submitted or the payment is requested promptly after such error or misrepresentation is eliminated or corrected. Notwithstanding the provisions of the third and fourth sentences preceding this sentence, the prevailing charge level in the case of a physician service in a particular locality determined pursuant to such third and fourth sentences for any calendar year after 1974 shall, if lower than the prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, in the case of a similar physician service in the same locality by reason of the application of economic index data, be raised to such prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and shall remain at such prevailing charge level until the prevailing charge for a year (as adjusted by economic index data) equals or exceeds such prevailing charge level. The amount of any charges for outpatient services which shall be considered reasonable shall be subject to the limitations established by regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1395x(v)(1)(K) of this title, and in determining the reasonable charge for such services, the Secretary may limit such reasonable charge to a percentage of the amount of the prevailing charge for similar services furnished in a physician's office, taking into account the extent to which overhead costs associated with such outpatient services have been included in the reasonable cost or charge of the facility. In applying subparagraph (B), the Secretary may specify exceptions to the 1 calendar year period specified in such subparagraph.

* (4)(A)(i) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.

* (ii)(I) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.

* (II) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall permit an additional one percentage point increase in the increase otherwise permitted under that sentence.

* (iii) In determining the maximum allowable prevailing charges which may be recognized consistent with the index described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, by participating physicians, the Secretary shall treat the maximum allowable prevailing charges recognized as of December 31, 1986, under such sentence with respect to participating physicians as having been justified by economic changes.

* (iv) The reasonable charge for physicians' services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, and before January 1, 1992, by a nonparticipating physician shall be no greater than the applicable percent of the prevailing charge levels established under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) (or under any other applicable provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level). In the previous sentence, the term "applicable percent" means for services furnished (I) on or after January 1, 1987, and before April 1, 1988, 96 percent, (II) on or after April 1, 1988, and before January 1, 1989, 95.5 percent, and (III) on or after January 1, 1989, 95 percent.

* (v) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.

* (vi) Before each year (beginning with 1989), the Secretary shall establish a prevailing charge floor for primary care services (as defined in subsection (i)(4)) equal to 60 percent of the estimated average prevailing charge levels based on the best available data (determined, under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) and under paragraph (4), without regard to this clause and without regard to physician specialty) for such service for all localities in the United States (weighted by the relative frequency of the service in each locality) for the year.

* (vii) Beginning with 1987, the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in subsection (i)(3)) for each year shall be the same for nonparticipating physicians as for participating physicians.

* (B)(i) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.

* (ii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) at the time of furnishing the services—

  * (I) if the physician was not a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983, and

  * (II) if the physician was a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the physician's customary charges shall be determined based upon the physician's actual charges billed during the 12-month period ending on March 31, 1985.


* (iii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.

* (iv) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians' services (other than primary care services, as defined in subsection (i)(4)) furnished during 1991, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1990. In a case in which subparagraph (F) applies (relating to new physicians) so as to limit the customary charges of a physician during 1990 to a percent of prevailing charges, the previous sentence shall not prevent such limit on customary charges under such subparagraph from increasing in 1991 to a higher percent of such prevailing charges.

* (C) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians' services furnished during periods beginning after September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall treat the level as set under subparagraph (A)(i) as having fully provided for the economic changes which would have been taken into account but for the limitations contained in subparagraph (A)(i).

* (D)(i) In determining the customary charges for physicians' services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, or the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who was not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) on September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 15-month period beginning on July 1, 1984, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed in the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.

* (ii) In determining the customary charges for physicians' services furnished during the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) on April 30, 1986, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 7-month period beginning on October 1, 1985, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed during the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.

* (iii) In determining the customary charges for physicians' services furnished during the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, or January 1, 1988, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1)) on December 31, 1986, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 8-month period beginning on May 1, 1986, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed during the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.

* (iv) In determining the customary charges for a physicians' service furnished on or after January 1, 1988, if a physician was a nonparticipating physician in a previous year (beginning with 1987), the Secretary shall not recognize any amount of such actual charges (for that service furnished during such previous year) that exceeds the maximum allowable actual charge for such service established under subsection (j)(1)(C).

* (E)(i) For purposes of this part for physicians' services furnished in 1987, the percentage increase in the MEI is 3.2 percent.

* (ii) For purposes of this part for physicians' services furnished in 1988, on or after April 1, the percentage increase in the MEI is—

  * (I) 3.6 percent for primary care services (as defined in subsection (i)(4)), and

* (6) No payment under this part for a service provided to any individual shall (except as provided in section 1395gg of this title) be made to anyone other than such individual or (pursuant to an assignment described in subparagraph (B)(ii) of paragraph (3)) the physician or other person who provided the service, except that (A) payment may be made (i) to the employer of such physician or other person if such physician or other person is required as a condition of his employment to turn over his fee for such service to his employer, or (ii) where the service was provided under a contractual arrangement between such physician or other person and an entity, to the entity if, under the contractual arrangement, the entity submits the bill for the service and the contractual arrangement meets such program integrity and other safeguards as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate, (B) payment may be made to an entity (i) which provides coverage of the services under a health benefits plan, but only to the extent that payment is not made under this part, (ii) which has paid the person who provided the service an amount (including the amount payable under this part) which that person has accepted as payment in full for the service, and (iii) to which the individual has agreed in writing that payment may be made under this part, (C) in the case of services described in clause (i) of section 1395x(s)(2)(K) of this title, for such services furnished before January 1, 2022, payment shall be made to either (i) the employer of the physician assistant involved, or (ii) with respect to a physician assistant who was the owner of a rural health clinic (as described in section 1395x(aa)(2) of this title) for a continuous period beginning prior to August 5, 1997, and ending on the date that the Secretary determines such rural health clinic no longer meets the requirements of section 1395x(aa)(2) of this title, payment may be made directly to the physician assistant, (D) payment may be made to a physician for physicians' services (and services furnished incident to such services) furnished by a second physician to patients of the first physician if (i) the first physician is unavailable to provide the services; (ii) the services are furnished pursuant to an arrangement between the two physicians that (I) is informal and reciprocal, or (II) involves per diem or other fee-for-time compensation for such services; (iii) the services are not provided by the second physician over a continuous period of more than 60 days or are provided over a longer continuous period during all of which the first physician has been called or ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces; and (iv) the claim form submitted to the medicare administrative contractor for such services includes the second physician's unique identifier (provided under the system established under subsection (r)) and indicates that the claim meets the requirements of this subparagraph for payment to the first physician, (E) in the case of an item or service (other than services described in section 1395yy(e)(2)(A)(ii) of this title) furnished by, or under arrangements made by, a skilled nursing facility to an individual who (at the time the item or service is furnished) is a resident of a skilled nursing facility, payment shall be made to the facility, (F) in the case of home health services (including medical supplies described in section 1395x(m)(5) of this title, but excluding durable medical equipment to the extent provided for in such section) furnished to an individual who (at the time the item or service is furnished) is under a plan of care of a home health agency, payment shall be made to the agency (without regard to whether or not the item or service was furnished by the agency, by others under arrangement with them made by the agency, or when any other contracting or consulting arrangement, or otherwise), (G) in the case of services in a hospital or clinic to which section 1395qq(e) of this title applies, payment shall be made to such hospital or clinic, (H) in the case of services described in section 1395x(aa)(3) of this title that are furnished by a health care professional under contract with a Federally qualified health center, payment shall be made to the center.

* (7)(A) In the case of physicians' services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title, the Secretary shall not provide (except on the basis described in subparagraph (C)) for payment for such services under this part—

  * (i) unless—

    * (I) the physician renders sufficient personal and identifiable physicians' services to the patient to exercise full, personal control over the management of the portion of the case for which the payment is sought,

    * (II) the services are of the same character as the services the physician furnishes to patients not entitled to benefits under this subchapter, and

    * (III) at least 25 percent of the hospital's patients (during a representative past period, as determined by the Secretary) who were not entitled to benefits under this subchapter and who were furnished services described in subclauses (I) and (II) paid all or a substantial part of charges (other than nominal charges) imposed for such services; and


  * (ii) to the extent that the payment is based upon a reasonable charge for the services in excess of the customary charge as determined in accordance with subparagraph (B).


* (B) The customary charge for such services in a hospital shall be determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary and taking into account the following factors:

  * (i) In the case of a physician who is not a teaching physician (as defined by the Secretary), the Secretary shall take into account the amounts the physician charges for similar services in the physician's practice outside the teaching setting.

  * (ii) In the case of a teaching physician, if the hospital, its physicians, or other appropriate billing entity has established one or more schedules of charges which are collected for medical and surgical services, the Secretary shall base payment under this subchapter on the greatest of—

    * (I) the charges (other than nominal charges) which are most frequently collected in full or substantial part with respect to patients who were not entitled to benefits under this subchapter and who were furnished services described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i),

    * (II) the mean of the charges (other than nominal charges) which were collected in full or substantial part with respect to such patients, or

    * (III) 85 percent of the prevailing charges paid for similar services in the same locality.


  * (iii) If all the teaching physicians in a hospital agree to have payment made for all of their physicians' services under this part furnished to patients in such hospital on an assignment-related basis, the customary charge for such services shall be equal to 90 percent of the prevailing charges paid for similar services in the same locality.


* (C) In the case of physicians' services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title, if the conditions described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i) are met and if the physician elects payment to be determined under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide for payment for such services under this part on the basis of regulations of the Secretary governing reimbursement for the services of hospital-based physicians (and not on any other basis).

* (D)(i) In the case of physicians' services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title, no payment shall be made under this part for services of assistants at surgery with respect to a surgical procedure if such hospital has a training program relating to the medical specialty required for such surgical procedure and a qualified individual on the staff of the hospital is available to provide such services; except that payment may be made under this part for such services, to the extent that such payment is otherwise allowed under this paragraph, if such services, as determined under regulations of the Secretary—

  * (I) are required due to exceptional medical circumstances,

  * (II) are performed by team physicians needed to perform complex medical procedures, or

  * (III) constitute concurrent medical care relating to a medical condition which requires the presence of, and active care by, a physician of another specialty during surgery,


* and under such other circumstances as the Secretary determines by regulation to be appropriate.

* (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "assistant at surgery" means a physician who actively assists the physician in charge of a case in performing a surgical procedure.

* (iii) The Secretary shall determine appropriate methods of reimbursement of assistants at surgery where such services are reimbursable under this part.

* (8)(A)(i) The Secretary shall by regulation—

  * (I) describe the factors to be used in determining the cases (of particular items or services) in which the application of this subchapter to payment under this part (other than to physicians' services paid under section 1395w–4 of this title) results in the determination of an amount that, because of its being grossly excessive or grossly deficient, is not inherently reasonable, and

  * (II) provide in those cases for the factors to be considered in determining an amount that is realistic and equitable.


* (ii) Notwithstanding the determination made in clause (i), the Secretary may not apply factors that would increase or decrease the payment under this part during any year for any particular item or service by more than 15 percent from such payment during the preceding year except as provided in subparagraph (B).

* (B) The Secretary may make a determination under this subparagraph that would result in an increase or decrease under subparagraph (A) of more than 15 percent of the payment amount for a year, but only if—

  * (ii) the Secretary's determination takes into account the potential impacts described in subparagraph (D), and

  * (iii) the Secretary complies with the procedural requirements of paragraph (9).


* (C) The factors described in this subparagraph are as follows:

  * (i) The programs established under this subchapter and subchapter XIX are the sole or primary sources of payment for an item or service.

  * (iii) The payment amount for an item or service under this part is substantially higher or lower than the payment made for the item or service by other purchasers.


* (D) The potential impacts of a determination under subparagraph (B) on quality, access, and beneficiary liability, including the likely effects on assignment rates and participation rates.

* (9)(A) The Secretary shall consult with representatives of suppliers or other individuals who furnish an item or service before making a determination under paragraph (8)(B) with regard to that item or service.

  * (ii) explaining the factors and data that the Secretary took into account in determining the payment amount so specified, and

  * (iii) explaining the potential impacts described in paragraph (8)(D).


* (C) After publication of the notice required by subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall allow not less than 60 days for public comment on the proposed determination.

* (vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, a "physician's actual charge" for a physicians' service furnished in a year or other period is the weighted average (or, at the option of the Secretary for a service furnished in the calendar quarter beginning April 1, 1984, the median) of the physician's charges for such service furnished in the year or other period.

* (vii) In the case of a nonparticipating physician who was a participating physician during a previous period, for the purpose of computing the physician's maximum allowable actual charge during the physician's period of nonparticipation, the physician shall be deemed to have had a maximum allowable actual charge during the period of participation, and such deemed maximum allowable actual charge shall be determined according to clauses (i) through (vi).

* (viii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, the maximum allowable actual charge for a particular physician's service furnished by a nonparticipating physician to individuals enrolled under this part during the 3-month period beginning on January 1, 1988, shall be the amount determined under this subparagraph for 1987.
