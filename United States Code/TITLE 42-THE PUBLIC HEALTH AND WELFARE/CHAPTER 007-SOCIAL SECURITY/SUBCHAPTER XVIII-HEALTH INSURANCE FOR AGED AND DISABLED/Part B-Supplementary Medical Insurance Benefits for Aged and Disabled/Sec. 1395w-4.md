  * #### (B) Division of specialty by component
    * The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians' services. Such percentages shall be based on national data that describe the elements of physician practice costs and revenues, by physician specialty. The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine practice costs and revenues for specialties for which adequate data are not available.

  * #### (C) Determination of component percentages
    * #### (i) Work percentage
      * The work percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of—

        * (I) the average percentage division for the work component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

        * (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

    * #### (ii) Practice expense percentage

    * Taking into account paragraph (1)(G), the Secretary shall specify a MIPS adjustment factor for each MIPS eligible professional for a year. Such MIPS adjustment factor for a MIPS eligible professional for a year shall be in the form of a percent and shall be determined—

      * (i) by comparing the composite performance score of the eligible professional for such year to the performance threshold established under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year;

      * (ii) in a manner such that the adjustment factors specified under this subparagraph for a year result in differential payments under this paragraph reflecting that—

        * (I) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year at or above such performance threshold for such year receive zero or positive payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iii), with such professionals having higher composite performance scores receiving higher adjustment factors; and

        * (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year below such performance threshold for such year receive negative payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iv), with such professionals having lower composite performance scores receiving lower adjustment factors;


      * (iii) in a manner such that MIPS eligible professionals with composite scores described in clause (ii)(I) for such year, subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (F), receive a zero or positive adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 100; and

      * (iv) in a manner such that—

        * (I) subject to subclause (II), MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores described in clause (ii)(II) for such year receive a negative payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 0; and

        * (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores that are equal to or greater than 0, but not greater than ¼ of the performance threshold specified under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, receive a negative payment adjustment factor that is equal to the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) for such year.

  * #### (B) Applicable percent defined
    * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "applicable percent" means—

      * (i) for 2019, 4 percent;

      * (ii) for 2020, 5 percent;

      * (iii) for 2021, 7 percent; and

    * For 2019 and each subsequent year through 2024, in the case of a MIPS eligible professional with a composite performance score for a year at or above the additional performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(ii) for such year, in addition to the MIPS adjustment factor under subparagraph (A) for the eligible professional for such year, subject to subparagraph (F)(iv), the Secretary shall specify an additional positive MIPS adjustment factor for such professional and year. Such additional MIPS adjustment factors shall be in the form of a percent and determined by the Secretary in a manner such that professionals having higher composite performance scores above the additional performance threshold receive higher additional MIPS adjustment factors.

  * #### (D) Establishment of performance thresholds
    * #### (i) Performance threshold
      * For each year of the MIPS, the Secretary shall compute a performance threshold with respect to which the composite performance score of MIPS eligible professionals shall be compared for purposes of determining adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) that are positive, negative, and zero. Subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), such performance threshold for a year shall be the mean or median (as selected by the Secretary) of the composite performance scores for all MIPS eligible professionals with respect to a prior period specified by the Secretary. The Secretary may reassess the selection of the mean or median under the previous sentence every 3 years.

    * #### (ii) Additional performance threshold for exceptional performance
      * In addition to the performance threshold under clause (i), for each year of the MIPS (beginning with 2019 and ending with 2024), the Secretary shall compute an additional performance threshold for purposes of determining the additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). For each such year, subject to clause (iii), the Secretary shall apply either of the following methods for computing such additional performance threshold for such a year:

        * (I) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the range of possible composite performance scores above the performance threshold determined under clause (i).

        * (II) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the actual composite performance scores for MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores at or above the performance threshold with respect to the prior period described in clause (i).

    * #### (iii) Special rule for initial 5 years
      * With respect to each of the first five years to which the MIPS applies, the Secretary shall, prior to the performance period for such years, establish a performance threshold for purposes of determining MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) and a threshold for purposes of determining additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). Each such performance threshold shall—

        * (I) be based on a period prior to such performance periods; and

        * (II) take into account—

          * (aa) data available with respect to performance on measures and activities that may be used under the performance categories under subparagraph (2)(B); and

          * (bb) other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary.

    * #### (iv) Additional special rule for third, fourth and fifth years of MIPS
      * For purposes of determining MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A), in addition to the requirements specified in clause (iii), the Secretary shall increase the performance threshold with respect to each of the third, fourth, and fifth years to which the MIPS applies to ensure a gradual and incremental transition to the performance threshold described in clause (i) (as estimated by the Secretary) with respect to the sixth year to which the MIPS applies.

  * #### (E) Application of MIPS adjustment factors
    * In the case of covered professional services (as defined in subsection (k)(3)(A)) furnished by a MIPS eligible professional during a year (beginning with 2019), the amount otherwise paid under this part with respect to such covered professional services and MIPS eligible professional for such year, shall be multiplied by—

      * (i) 1, plus

      * (ii) the sum of—

        * (I) the MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (A) divided by 100, and

        * (II) as applicable, the additional MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (C) divided by 100.

  * #### (F) Aggregate application of MIPS adjustment factors
    * #### (i) Application of scaling factor
      * #### (I) In general
        * With respect to positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) for eligible professionals whose composite performance score is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, subject to subclause (II), the Secretary shall increase or decrease such adjustment factors by a scaling factor in order to ensure that the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) is met.

      * #### (II) Scaling factor limit
        * In no case may the scaling factor applied under this clause exceed 3.0.

    * #### (ii) Budget neutrality requirement
      * #### (I) In general
        * Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary shall ensure that the estimated amount described in subclause (II) for a year is equal to the estimated amount described in subclause (III) for such year.

      * #### (II) Aggregate increases
        * The amount described in this subclause is the estimated increase in the aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) (after application of the scaling factor described in clause (i)) to MIPS eligible professionals whose composite performance score for a year is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year.

      * #### (III) Aggregate decreases
