### §1395r. Amount of premiums for individuals enrolled under this part
#### (a) Determination of monthly actuarial rates and premiums
* (1) The Secretary shall, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to those enrollees age 65 and older will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin. In applying this paragraph there shall not be taken into account additional payments under section 1395w–4(o) of this title and section 1395w–23(l)(3) of this title and the Government contribution under section 1395w(a)(3) of this title.

* (2) The monthly premium of each individual enrolled under this part for each month after December 1983 shall be the amount determined under paragraph (3), adjusted as required in accordance with subsections (b), (c), (f), and (i), and to reflect any credit provided under section 1395w–24(b)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of this title.

* (3) The Secretary, during September of each year, shall determine and promulgate a monthly premium rate for the succeeding calendar year that (except as provided in subsection (g)) is equal to 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over, determined according to paragraph (1), for that succeeding calendar year. Whenever the Secretary promulgates the dollar amount which shall be applicable as the monthly premium rate for any period, he shall, at the time such promulgation is announced, issue a public statement setting forth the actuarial assumptions and bases employed by him in arriving at the amount of an adequate actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and older as provided in paragraph (1).

* (4) The Secretary shall also, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for disabled enrollees under age 65 which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to disabled enrollees under age 65 will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate under this paragraph, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin.

* (5)(A) In applying this part (including subsection (i) and section 1395l(b) of this title), the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for 2016 shall be determined as if subsection (f) did not apply.

* (B) Subsection (f) shall continue to be applied to paragraph (6)(A) (during a repayment month, as described in paragraph (6)(B)) and without regard to the application of subparagraph (A).

* (6)(A) With respect to a repayment month (as described in subparagraph (B)), the monthly premium otherwise established under paragraph (3) shall be increased by, subject to subparagraph (D), $3.

* (B) For purposes of this paragraph, a repayment month is a month during a year, beginning with 2016, for which a balance due amount is computed under subparagraph (C) as greater than zero.

* (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the balance due amount computed under this subparagraph, with respect to a month, is the amount estimated by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to be equal to—

  * (i) the amount transferred under section 1395w(d)(1) of this title; plus

  * (ii) the amount that is equal to the aggregate reduction, for all individuals enrolled under this part, in the income related monthly adjustment amount as a result of the application of paragraph (5); minus

  * (iii) the amounts payable under this part as a result of the application of this paragraph for preceding months.


* (D) If the balance due amount computed under subparagraph (C), without regard to this subparagraph, for December of a year would be less than zero, the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall estimate, and the Secretary shall apply, a reduction to the dollar amount increase applied under subparagraph (A) for each month during such year in a manner such that the balance due amount for January of the subsequent year is equal to zero.

#### (b) Increase in monthly premium
* In the case of an individual whose coverage period began pursuant to an enrollment after his initial enrollment period (determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of section 1395p of this title) and not pursuant to a special enrollment period under subsection (i)(4) or (l) of section 1395p of this title, the monthly premium determined under subsection (a) (without regard to any adjustment under subsection (i)) shall be increased by 10 percent of the monthly premium so determined for each full 12 months (in the same continuous period of eligibility) in which he could have been but was not enrolled. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be taken into account (1) the months which elapsed between the close of his initial enrollment period and the close of the enrollment period in which he enrolled, plus (in the case of an individual who reenrolls) (2) the months which elapsed between the date of termination of a previous coverage period and the close of the enrollment period in which he reenrolled, but there shall not be taken into account months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a group health plan described in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title by reason of the individual's (or the individual's spouse's) current employment status or months during which the individual has not attained the age of 65 and for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a large group health plan (as that term is defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title) by reason of the individual's current employment status (or the current employment status of a family member of the individual) or months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was an individual described in section 1395p(k)(3) of this title. Any increase in an individual's monthly premium under the first sentence of this subsection with respect to a particular continuous period of eligibility shall not be applicable with respect to any other continuous period of eligibility which such individual may have. No increase in the premium shall be effected for a month in the case of an individual who enrolls under this part during 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 and who demonstrates to the Secretary before December 31, 2004, that the individual is a covered beneficiary (as defined in section 1072(5) of title 10). The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consult with the Secretary of Defense in identifying individuals described in the previous sentence.

#### (c) Premiums rounded to nearest multiple of ten cents
* If any monthly premium determined under the foregoing provisions of this section is not a multiple of 10 cents, such premium shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 cents.

#### (d) "Continuous period of eligibility" defined
* For purposes of subsection (b) (and section 1395p(g)(1) of this title), an individual's "continuous period of eligibility" is the period beginning with the first day on which he is eligible to enroll under section 1395o of this title and ending with his death; except that any period during all of which an individual satisfied paragraph (1) of section 1395o of this title and which terminated in or before the month preceding the month in which he attained age 65 shall be a separate "continuous period of eligibility" with respect to such individual (and each such period which terminates shall be deemed not to have existed for purposes of subsequently applying this section).

#### (e) State payment of part B late enrollment premium increases
* (1) Upon the request of a State (or any appropriate State or local governmental entity specified by the Secretary), the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State (or such entity) under which the State (or such entity) agrees to pay on a quarterly or other periodic basis to the Secretary (to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund) an amount equal to the amount of the part B late enrollment premium increases with respect to the premiums for eligible individuals (as defined in paragraph (3)(A)).

* (2) No part B late enrollment premium increase shall apply to an eligible individual for premiums for months for which the amount of such an increase is payable under an agreement under paragraph (1).

* (3) In this subsection:

  * (A) The term "eligible individual" means an individual who is enrolled under this part B and who is within a class of individuals specified in the agreement under paragraph (1).

  * (B) The term "part B late enrollment premium increase" means any increase in a premium as a result of the application of subsection (b).

#### (f) Limitation on increase in monthly premium
* For any calendar year after 1988, if an individual is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title or to a monthly annuity under section 3(a), 4(a), or 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231b(a), 231c(a), (f)] for November and December of the preceding year, if the monthly premium of the individual under this section for December and for January is deducted from those benefits under section 1395s(a)(1) of this title or section 1395s(b)(1) of this title, and if the amount of the individual's premium is not adjusted for such January under subsection (i), the monthly premium otherwise determined under this section for an individual for that year shall not be increased, pursuant to this subsection, to the extent that such increase would reduce the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that December below the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that November (after the deduction of the premium under this section). For purposes of this subsection, retroactive adjustments or payments and deductions on account of work shall not be taken into account in determining the monthly benefits to which an individual is entitled under section 402 or 423 of this title or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].

#### (g) Exclusions from estimate of benefits and administrative costs
* In estimating the benefits and administrative costs which will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for a year for purposes of determining the monthly premium rate under subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall exclude an estimate of any benefits and administrative costs attributable to—

  * (1) the application of section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(viii) of this title or to the establishment under section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(i)(V) of this title of a per visit limit at 106 percent of the median (instead of 105 percent of the median), but only to the extent payment for home health services under this subchapter is not being made under section 1395fff of this title (relating to prospective payment for home health services); and

  * (2) the medicare prescription drug discount card and transitional assistance program under section 1395w–141 of this title.

* #### (2) No effect on late enrollment penalty or income-related adjustment in subsidies
  * Nothing in this subsection or section 1395w–29(f) of this title shall be construed as affecting the amount of any premium adjustment under subsection (b) or (i). Subsection (f) shall be applied without regard to any premium adjustment referred to in paragraph (1).

* #### (3) Implementation
  * In order to carry out a premium adjustment under this subsection and section 1395w–29(f) of this title (insofar as it is effected through the manner of collection of premiums under section 1395s(a) of this title), the Secretary shall transmit to the Commissioner of Social Security—

    * (A) at the beginning of each year, the name, social security account number, and the amount of the premium adjustment (if any) for each individual enrolled under this part for each month during the year; and
