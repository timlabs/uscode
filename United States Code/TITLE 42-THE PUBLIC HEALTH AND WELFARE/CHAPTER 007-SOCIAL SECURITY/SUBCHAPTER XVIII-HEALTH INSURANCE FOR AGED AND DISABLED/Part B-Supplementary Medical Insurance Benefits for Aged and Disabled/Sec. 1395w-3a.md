#### (b) Payment amount
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to paragraph (7) and subsections (d)(3)(C) and (e), the amount of payment determined under this section for the billing and payment code for a drug or biological (based on a minimum dosage unit) is, subject to applicable deductible and coinsurance—

    * (A) in the case of a multiple source drug (as defined in subsection (c)(6)(C)), 106 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (3) for a multiple source drug furnished before April 1, 2008, or 106 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (6) for a multiple source drug furnished on or after April 1, 2008;

    * (B) in the case of a single source drug or biological (as defined in subsection (c)(6)(D)), 106 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (4); or

    * (C) in the case of a biosimilar biological product (as defined in subsection (c)(6)(H)), the amount determined under paragraph (8).

* #### (2) Specification of unit
  * #### (A) Specification by manufacturer
    * The manufacturer of a drug or biological shall specify the unit associated with each National Drug Code (including package size) as part of the submission of data under section 1396r–8(b)(3)(A)(iii) of this title or subsection (f)(2), as applicable.

  * #### (B) Unit defined
    * In this section, the term "unit" means, with respect to each National Drug Code (including package size) associated with a drug or biological, the lowest identifiable quantity (such as a capsule or tablet, milligram of molecules, or grams) of the drug or biological that is dispensed, exclusive of any diluent without reference to volume measures pertaining to liquids. For years after 2004, the Secretary may establish the unit for a manufacturer to report and methods for counting units as the Secretary determines appropriate to implement this section.

* #### (3) Multiple source drug
  * For all drug products included within the same multiple source drug billing and payment code, the amount specified in this paragraph is the volume-weighted average of the average sales prices reported under section 1396r–8(b)(3)(A)(iii) of this title or subsection (f)(2), as applicable, determined by—

    * (A) computing the sum of the products (for each National Drug Code assigned to such drug products) of—

      * (i) the manufacturer's average sales price (as defined in subsection (c)); and

      * (ii) the total number of units specified under paragraph (2) sold; and

  * The payment amount shall be determined under this subsection based on information reported under subsection (f) and without regard to any special packaging, labeling, or identifiers on the dosage form or product or package.

* #### (6) Use of volume-weighted average sales prices in calculation of average sales price
  * #### (A) In general
    * For all drug products included within the same multiple source drug billing and payment code, the amount specified in this paragraph is the volume-weighted average of the average sales prices reported under section 1396r–8(b)(3)(A)(iii) of this title or subsection (f)(2), as applicable, determined by—

      * (i) computing the sum of the products (for each National Drug Code assigned to such drug products) of—

        * (I) the manufacturer's average sales price (as defined in subsection (c)), determined by the Secretary without dividing such price by the total number of billing units for the National Drug Code for the billing and payment code; and

        * (II) the total number of units specified under paragraph (2) sold; and


      * (ii) dividing the sum determined under clause (i) by the sum of the products (for each National Drug Code assigned to such drug products) of—

        * (I) the total number of units specified under paragraph (2) sold; and

        * (II) the total number of billing units for the National Drug Code for the billing and payment code.

  * #### (B) Billing unit defined
    * For purposes of this subsection, the term "billing unit" means the identifiable quantity associated with a billing and payment code, as established by the Secretary.

* #### (7) Special rule
  * Beginning with April 1, 2008, the payment amount for—

    * (A) each single source drug or biological described in section 1395u(o)(1)(G) of this title that is treated as a multiple source drug because of the application of subsection (c)(6)(C)(ii) is the lower of—

      * (i) the payment amount that would be determined for such drug or biological applying such subsection; or

      * (ii) the payment amount that would have been determined for such drug or biological if such subsection were not applied; and


    * (B) a multiple source drug described in section 1395u(o)(1)(G) of this title (excluding a drug or biological that is treated as a multiple source drug because of the application of such subsection) is the lower of—

      * (i) the payment amount that would be determined for such drug or biological taking into account the application of such subsection; or

      * (ii) the payment amount that would have been determined for such drug or biological if such subsection were not applied.

* #### (8) Biosimilar biological product
  * The amount specified in this paragraph for a biosimilar biological product described in paragraph (1)(C) is the sum of—

    * (A) the average sales price as determined using the methodology described under paragraph (6) applied to a biosimilar biological product for all National Drug Codes assigned to such product in the same manner as such paragraph is applied to drugs described in such paragraph; and

    * (B) 6 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (4) for the reference biological product (as defined in subsection (c)(6)(I)).

#### (c) Manufacturer's average sales price
* #### (1) In general
  * For purposes of this section, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the manufacturer's "average sales price" means, of a drug or biological for a National Drug Code for a calendar quarter for a manufacturer for a unit—

    * (A) the manufacturer's sales to all purchasers (excluding sales exempted in paragraph (2)) in the United States for such drug or biological in the calendar quarter; divided by

    * (B) the total number of such units of such drug or biological sold by the manufacturer in such quarter.

* #### (2) Certain sales exempted from computation
  * In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price under this subsection, the following sales shall be excluded:

  * #### (A) Sales exempt from best price
    * Sales exempt from the inclusion in the determination of "best price" under section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C)(i) of this title.

  * #### (B) Sales at nominal charge
    * Such other sales as the Secretary identifies as sales to an entity that are merely nominal in amount (as applied for purposes of section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of this title, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide).

* #### (3) Sale price net of discounts
  * In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price under this subsection, such price shall include volume discounts, prompt pay discounts, cash discounts, free goods that are contingent on any purchase requirement, chargebacks, and rebates (other than rebates under section 1396r–8 of this title). For years after 2004, the Secretary may include in such price other price concessions, which may be based on recommendations of the Inspector General, that would result in a reduction of the cost to the purchaser.

* #### (4) Payment methodology in cases where average sales price during first quarter of sales is unavailable
  * In the case of a drug or biological during an initial period (not to exceed a full calendar quarter) in which data on the prices for sales for the drug or biological is not sufficiently available from the manufacturer to compute an average sales price for the drug or biological, the Secretary may determine the amount payable under this section—

    * (A) in the case of a drug or biological furnished prior to January 1, 2019, based on—

      * (i) the wholesale acquisition cost; or

      * (ii) the methodologies in effect under this part on November 1, 2003, to determine payment amounts for drugs or biologicals; and


    * (B) in the case of a drug or biological furnished on or after January 1, 2019—

      * (i) at an amount not to exceed 103 percent of the wholesale acquisition cost; or

      * (ii) based on the methodologies in effect under this part on November 1, 2003, to determine payment amounts for drugs or biologicals.

* #### (5) Frequency of determinations
  * #### (A) In general on a quarterly basis
    * The manufacturer's average sales price, for a drug or biological of a manufacturer, shall be calculated by such manufacturer under this subsection on a quarterly basis. In making such calculation insofar as there is a lag in the reporting of the information on rebates and chargebacks under paragraph (3) so that adequate data are not available on a timely basis, the manufacturer shall apply a methodology based on a 12-month rolling average for the manufacturer to estimate costs attributable to rebates and chargebacks. For years after 2004, the Secretary may establish a uniform methodology under this subparagraph to estimate and apply such costs.

  * #### (B) Updates in payment amounts
    * The payment amounts under subsection (b) shall be updated by the Secretary on a quarterly basis and shall be applied based upon the manufacturer's average sales price calculated for the most recent calendar quarter for which data is available.

  * #### (C) Use of contractors; implementation
    * The Secretary may contract with appropriate entities to calculate the payment amount under subsection (b). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may implement, by program instruction or otherwise, any of the provisions of this section.

* #### (6) Definitions and other rules
  * In this section:
