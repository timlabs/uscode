* The termination of a coverage period under paragraph (1) shall (except as otherwise provided in section 1395v(e) of this title) take effect at the close of the month following the month in which the notice is filed. The termination of a coverage period under paragraph (2) shall take effect on a date determined under regulations, which may be determined so as to provide a grace period in which overdue premiums may be paid and coverage continued.

Where an individual who is deemed enrolled for medical insurance benefits pursuant to section 1395p(f) of this title or section 1395p(n)(3) of this title files a notice requesting termination of his deemed coverage in or after the month in which such coverage becomes effective, the termination of such coverage shall take effect at the close of the month following the month in which the notice is filed.

#### (d) Payment of expenses incurred during coverage period
* No payments may be made under this part with respect to the expenses of an individual unless such expenses were incurred by such individual during a period which, with respect to him, is a coverage period.
