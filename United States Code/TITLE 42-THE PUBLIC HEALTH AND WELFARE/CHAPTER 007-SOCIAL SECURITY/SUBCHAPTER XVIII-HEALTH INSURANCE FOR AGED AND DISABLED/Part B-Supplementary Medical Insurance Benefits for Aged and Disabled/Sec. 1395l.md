Under such process, if the Secretary does not make a decision on such a request for an exception within 10 business days of the date of the Secretary's receipt of the request made in accordance with such requirement, the Secretary shall be deemed to have found the services to be medically necessary.

* (B) In the case of outpatient therapy services for which an exception is requested under the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the claim for such services shall contain an appropriate modifier (such as the KX modifier used as of February 22, 2012) indicating that such services are medically necessary as justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record involved.

* (C)(i) In applying this paragraph with respect to a request for an exception with respect to expenses that would be incurred for outpatient therapy services (including services described in subsection (a)(8)(B)) that would exceed the threshold described in clause (ii) for a year, the request for such an exception, for services furnished on or after October 1, 2012, shall be subject to a manual medical review process that, subject to subparagraph (E), is similar to the manual medical review process used for certain exceptions under this paragraph in 2006.

* (ii) The threshold under this clause for a year is $3,700. Such threshold shall be applied separately—

  * (I) for physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services; and

  * (II) for occupational therapy services.


* (E)(i) In place of the manual medical review process under subparagraph (C)(i), the Secretary shall implement a process for medical review under this subparagraph under which the Secretary shall identify and conduct medical review for services described in subparagraph (C)(i) furnished by a provider of services or supplier (in this subparagraph referred to as a "therapy provider") using such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

* (ii) Such factors may include the following:

  * (I) The therapy provider has had a high claims denial percentage for therapy services under this part or is less compliant with applicable requirements under this subchapter.

  * #### (iii) Application
    * The threshold under clause (ii) shall be applied separately—

      * (I) for physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services; and

      * (II) for occupational therapy services.

  * #### (iv) Funding
    * For purposes of carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide for the transfer, from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395t of this title to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account, of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2018, to remain available until expended. Such funds may not be used by a contractor under section 1395ddd(h) of this title for medical reviews under this subparagraph.


* (8) With respect to services furnished on or after January 1, 2013, where payment may not be made as a result of application of paragraphs (1) and (3), section 1395pp of this title shall apply in the same manner as such section applies to a denial that is made by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) of this title.

#### (h) Fee schedules for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests; percentage of prevailing charge level; nominal fee for samples; adjustments; recipients of payments; negotiated payment rate
* (1)(A) Subject to section 1395m(d)(1) of this title, the Secretary shall establish fee schedules for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (including prostate cancer screening tests under section 1395x(oo) of this title consisting of prostate-specific antigen blood tests) for which payment is made under this part, other than such tests performed by a provider of services for an inpatient of such provider.

* (B) In the case of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests performed by a physician or by a laboratory (other than tests performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for outpatients of such hospital), the fee schedules established under subparagraph (A) shall be established on a regional, statewide, or carrier service area basis (as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate) for tests furnished on or after July 1, 1984.

* (C) In the case of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for outpatients of such hospital, the fee schedules established under subparagraph (A) shall be established on a regional, statewide, or carrier service area basis (as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate) for tests furnished on or after July 1, 1984.

* (D) In this subsection, the term "qualified hospital laboratory" means a hospital laboratory, in a sole community hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(iii) of this title), which provides some clinical diagnostic laboratory tests 24 hours a day in order to serve a hospital emergency room which is available to provide services 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

* (2)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (v), subparagraph (B), and paragraph (4), the Secretary shall set the fee schedules at 60 percent (or, in the case of a test performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in paragraph (1)(D)) for outpatients of such hospital, 62 percent) of the prevailing charge level determined pursuant to the third and fourth sentences of section 1395u(b)(3) of this title for similar clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for the applicable region, State, or area for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1984, adjusted annually (to become effective on January 1 of each year) by, subject to clause (iv), a percentage increase or decrease equal to the percentage increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (United States city average) minus, for each of the years 2009 and 2010, 0.5 percentage points, and, for tests furnished before April 1, 2014, subject to such other adjustments as the Secretary determines are justified by technological changes.

* (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i)—

  * (I) any change in the fee schedules which would have become effective under this subsection for tests furnished on or after January 1, 1988, shall not be effective for tests furnished during the 3-month period beginning on January 1, 1988,

  * (II) the Secretary shall not adjust the fee schedules under clause (i) to take into account any increase in the consumer price index for 1988,

  * (III) the annual adjustment in the fee schedules determined under clause (i) for each of the years 1991, 1992, and 1993 shall be 2 percent, and

  * (IV) the annual adjustment in the fee schedules determined under clause (i) for each of the years 1994 and 1995, 1998 through 2002, and 2004 through 2008 shall be 0 percent.


* (iii) In establishing fee schedules under clause (i) with respect to automated tests and tests (other than cytopathology tests) which before July 1, 1984, the Secretary made subject to a limit based on lowest charge levels under the sixth sentence of section 1395u(b)(3) of this title performed after March 31, 1988, the Secretary shall reduce by 8.3 percent the fee schedules otherwise established for 1988, and such reduced fee schedules shall serve as the base for 1989 and subsequent years.

* (iv) After determining the adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i), the Secretary shall reduce such adjustment—

  * (I) for 2011 and each subsequent year, by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title; and

  * (II) for each of 2011 through 2015, by 1.75 percentage points.


* Subclause (I) shall not apply in a year where the adjustment to the fee schedules determined under clause (i) is 0.0 or a percentage decrease for a year. The application of the productivity adjustment under subclause (I) shall not result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year. The application of subclause (II) may result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

* (v) The Secretary shall reduce by 2 percent the fee schedules otherwise determined under clause (i) for 2013, and such reduced fee schedules shall serve as the base for 2014 and subsequent years.

* (B) The Secretary may make further adjustments or exceptions to the fee schedules to assure adequate reimbursement of (i) emergency laboratory tests needed for the provision of bona fide emergency services, and (ii) certain low volume high-cost tests where highly sophisticated equipment or extremely skilled personnel are necessary to assure quality.

* (3) In addition to the amounts provided under the fee schedules (for tests furnished before January 1, 2017) or under section 1395m–1 of this title (for tests furnished on or after January 1, 2017), subject to subsection (b)(5) of such section, the Secretary shall provide for and establish (A) a nominal fee to cover the appropriate costs in collecting the sample on which a clinical diagnostic laboratory test was performed and for which payment is made under this part, except that not more than one such fee may be provided under this paragraph with respect to samples collected in the same encounter, and (B) a fee to cover the transportation and personnel expenses for trained personnel to travel to the location of an individual to collect the sample, except that such a fee may be provided only with respect to an individual who is homebound or an inpatient in an inpatient facility (other than a hospital). In establishing a fee to cover the transportation and personnel expenses for trained personnel to travel to the location of an individual to collect a sample, the Secretary shall provide a method for computing the fee based on the number of miles traveled and the personnel costs associated with the collection of each individual sample, but the Secretary shall only be required to apply such method in the case of tests furnished during the period beginning on April 1, 1989, and ending on December 31, 1990, by a laboratory that establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary (based on data for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1988) that (i) the laboratory is dependent upon payments under this subchapter for at least 80 percent of its collected revenues for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, (ii) at least 85 percent of its gross revenues for such tests are attributable to tests performed with respect to individuals who are homebound or who are residents in a nursing facility, and (iii) the laboratory provided such tests for residents in nursing facilities representing at least 20 percent of the number of such facilities in the State in which the laboratory is located.

* (4)(A) In establishing any fee schedule under this subsection, the Secretary may provide for an adjustment to take into account, with respect to the portion of the expenses of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests attributable to wages, the relative difference between a region's or local area's wage rates and the wage rate presumed in the data on which the schedule is based.

* (B) For purposes of subsections (a)(1)(D)(i) and (a)(2)(D)(i), the limitation amount for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test performed—

  * (i) on or after July 1, 1986, and before April 1, 1988, is equal to 115 percent of the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

  * (ii) after March 31, 1988, and before January 1, 1990, is equal to the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

  * (iii) after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 1991, is equal to 93 percent of the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

  * (iv) after December 31, 1990, and before January 1, 1994, is equal to 88 percent of such median,

  * (v) after December 31, 1993, and before January 1, 1995, is equal to 84 percent of such median,

  * (vi) after December 31, 1994, and before January 1, 1996, is equal to 80 percent of such median,

  * (vii) after December 31, 1995, and before January 1, 1998, is equal to 76 percent of such median, and

  * (viii) after December 31, 1997, is equal to 74 percent of such median (or 100 percent of such median in the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test performed on or after January 1, 2001, that the Secretary determines is a new test for which no limitation amount has previously been established under this subparagraph).


* (5)(A) In the case of a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part on an assignment-related basis or under a provider agreement under section 1395cc of this title, payment may be made only to the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of such test; except that—

  * (i) if a physician performed or supervised the performance of such test, payment may be made to another physician with whom he shares his practice,

  * (ii) in the case of a test performed at the request of a laboratory by another laboratory, payment may be made to the referring laboratory but only if—

    * (I) the referring laboratory is located in, or is part of, a rural hospital,

    * (II) the referring laboratory is wholly owned by the entity performing such test, the referring laboratory wholly owns the entity performing such test, or both the referring laboratory and the entity performing such test are wholly-owned by a third entity, or

    * (III) not more than 30 percent of the clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for which such referring laboratory (but not including a laboratory described in subclause (II)), receives requests for testing during the year in which the test is performed are performed by another laboratory, and


  * (iii) in the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test provided under an arrangement (as defined in section 1395x(w)(1) of this title) made by a hospital, critical access hospital, or skilled nursing facility, payment shall be made to the hospital or skilled nursing facility.


* (B) In the case of such a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part, and which is not described in subparagraph (A), payment may be made to the beneficiary only on the basis of the itemized bill of the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of the test.

* (C) Payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician's office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic may only be made on an assignment-related basis or to a provider of services with an agreement in effect under section 1395cc of this title.

* (D) A person may not bill for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician's office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic, other than on an assignment-related basis. If a person knowingly and willfully and on a repeated basis bills for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test in violation of the previous sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the person in the same manner as the Secretary may apply sanctions against a physician in accordance with paragraph (2) of section 1395u(j) of this title in the same manner such paragraphs apply with respect to a physician. Paragraph (4) of such section shall apply in this subparagraph in the same manner as such paragraph applies to such section.

* (6) For tests furnished before January 1, 2017, in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test payment for which is not made on the basis of a fee schedule under paragraph (1), the Secretary may establish a payment rate which is acceptable to the person or entity performing the test and which would be considered the full charge for such tests. Such negotiated rate shall be limited to an amount not in excess of the total payment that would have been made for the services in the absence of such rate.

* (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4) and section 1395m–1 of this title, the Secretary shall establish a national minimum payment amount under this part for a diagnostic or screening pap smear laboratory test (including all cervical cancer screening technologies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a primary screening method for detection of cervical cancer) equal to $14.60 for tests furnished in 2000. For such tests furnished in subsequent years, such national minimum payment amount shall be adjusted annually as provided in paragraph (2).

* (8)(A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for determining the basis for, and amount of, payment under this subsection for any clinical diagnostic laboratory test with respect to which a new or substantially revised HCPCS code is assigned on or after January 1, 2005 (in this paragraph referred to as "new tests").

* (B) Determinations under subparagraph (A) shall be made only after the Secretary—

  * (i) makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list that includes any such test for which establishment of a payment amount under this subsection is being considered for a year;

  * (ii) on the same day such list is made available, causes to have published in the Federal Register notice of a meeting to receive comments and recommendations (and data on which recommendations are based) from the public on the appropriate basis under this subsection for establishing payment amounts for the tests on such list;

  * (iii) not less than 30 days after publication of such notice convenes a meeting, that includes representatives of officials of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services involved in determining payment amounts, to receive such comments and recommendations (and data on which the recommendations are based);

  * (iv) taking into account the comments and recommendations (and accompanying data) received at such meeting, develops and makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list of proposed determinations with respect to the appropriate basis for establishing a payment amount under this subsection for each such code, together with an explanation of the reasons for each such determination, the data on which the determinations are based, and a request for public written comments on the proposed determination; and

  * (v) taking into account the comments received during the public comment period, develops and makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list of final determinations of the payment amounts for such tests under this subsection, together with the rationale for each such determination, the data on which the determinations are based, and responses to comments and suggestions received from the public.


* (C) Under the procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—

  * (i) set forth the criteria for making determinations under subparagraph (A); and

  * (ii) make available to the public the data (other than proprietary data) considered in making such determinations.


* (D) The Secretary may convene such further public meetings to receive public comments on payment amounts for new tests under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate.

* (E) For purposes of this paragraph:

  * (i) The term "HCPCS" refers to the Health Care Procedure Coding System.

  * (ii) A code shall be considered to be "substantially revised" if there is a substantive change to the definition of the test or procedure to which the code applies (such as a new analyte or a new methodology for measuring an existing analyte-specific test).


* (9) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test for HbA1c that is labeled by the Food and Drug Administration for home use and is furnished on or after April 1, 2008, the payment rate for such test shall be the payment rate established under this part for a glycated hemoglobin test (identified as of October 1, 2007, by HCPCS code 83036 (and any succeeding codes)).

#### (i) Outpatient surgery
* (1) The Secretary shall, in consultation with appropriate medical organizations—

  * (A) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in an ambulatory surgical center (meeting the standards specified under section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title), critical access hospital, or hospital outpatient department, and

  * (B) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in a physician's office.


* The lists of procedures established under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be reviewed and updated not less often than every 2 years, in consultation with appropriate trade and professional organizations.

* (2)(A) For services furnished prior to the implementation of the system described in subparagraph (D), subject to subparagraph (E), the amount of payment to be made for facility services furnished in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) and furnished to an individual in an ambulatory surgical center described in such paragraph shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary's estimate of a fair fee which—

  * (i) takes into account the costs incurred by such centers, or classes of centers, generally in providing services furnished in connection with the performance of such procedure, as determined in accordance with a survey (based upon a representative sample of procedures and facilities) of the actual audited costs incurred by such centers in providing such services,

  * (ii) takes such costs into account in such a manner as will assure that the performance of the procedure in such a center will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the procedure had been performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital, and

  * (iii) in the case of insertion of an intraocular lens during or subsequent to cataract surgery includes payment which is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved.


* Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.

* (B) The amount of payment to be made under this part for facility services furnished, in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), in a physician's office shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary's estimate of a fair fee which—

  * (i) takes into account additional costs, not usually included in the professional fee, incurred by physicians in securing, maintaining, and staffing the facilities and ancillary services appropriate for the performance of such procedure in the physician's office, and

  * (ii) takes such items into account in such a manner which will assure that the performance of such procedure in the physician's office will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the services had been furnished on an inpatient basis in a hospital.


* Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.

* (C)(i) Notwithstanding the second sentence of each of subparagraphs (A) and (B), except as otherwise specified in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), if the Secretary has not updated amounts established under such subparagraphs or under subparagraph (D), with respect to facility services furnished during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986 or a calendar year (beginning with 2006)), such amounts shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the year involved.

* (ii) In each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the increase under this subparagraph shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2.0 percentage points.

* (iii) In fiscal year 2004, beginning with April 1, 2004, the increase under this subparagraph shall be the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with March 31, 2003, minus 3.0 percentage points.

* (iv) In fiscal year 2005, the last quarter of calendar year 2005, and each of calendar years 2006 through 2009, the increase under this subparagraph shall be 0 percent.

* (D)(i) Taking into account the recommendations in the report under section 626(d) of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary shall implement a revised payment system for payment of surgical services furnished in ambulatory surgical centers.

* (ii) In the year the system described in clause (i) is implemented, such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services as would be made if this subparagraph did not apply, as estimated by the Secretary and taking into account reduced expenditures that would apply if subparagraph (E) were to continue to apply, as estimated by the Secretary.

* (iii) The Secretary shall implement the system described in clause (i) for periods in a manner so that it is first effective beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and not later than January 1, 2008.

* (iv) The Secretary may implement such system in a manner so as to provide for a reduction in any annual update for failure to report on quality measures in accordance with paragraph (7).

      * The Secretary shall establish rules for establishment of an unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service not furnished during 1996, based upon its classification within a group of such services.

  * #### (C) Calculation of conversion factors
    * #### (i) For 1999
      * #### (I) In general
        * The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A).

      * #### (II) Product described
        * The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group.

    * #### (ii) Subsequent years
      * Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iv) for the year involved.

    * #### (iii) Adjustment for service mix changes
      * Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

    * #### (iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor
      * For purposes of this subparagraph, subject to paragraph (17) and subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the "OPD fee schedule increase factor" for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.

  * #### (D) Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts
    * The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of—

      * (i) the conversion factor computed under subparagraph (C) for the year, and

      * (ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group.

  * #### (E) Pre-deductible payment percentage
    * The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of—

      * (i) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under subparagraph (D) for the year, minus the unadjusted copayment amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the service or group, to

      * (ii) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (D) for the year for such service or group.

  * #### (F) Productivity and other adjustment
    * After determining the OPD fee schedule increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor—

      * (i) for 2012 and subsequent years, by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title; and

      * (ii) for each of 2010 through 2019, by the adjustment described in subparagraph (G).


  * The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

  * #### (G) Other adjustment
    * For purposes of subparagraph (F)(ii), the adjustment described in this subparagraph is—

      * (i) for each of 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;

      * (ii) for each of 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;

      * (iii) for 2014, 0.3 percentage point;

      * (iv) for each of 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and

      * (v) for each of 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point.

* #### (4) Medicare payment amount
  * The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows:

  * #### (A) Fee schedule adjustments
    * The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E).

  * #### (B) Subtract applicable deductible
    * Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b), to the extent applicable.

  * #### (C) Apply payment proportion to remainder
    * The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).

* #### (5) Outlier adjustment
  * #### (A) In general
    * Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital's charges, adjusted to cost, exceed—

      * (i) a fixed multiple of the sum of—

        * (I) the applicable medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (3)(D), as adjusted under paragraph (4)(A) (other than for adjustments under this paragraph or paragraph (6)); and

        * (II) any transitional pass-through payment under paragraph (6); and


      * (ii) at the option of the Secretary, such fixed dollar amount as the Secretary may establish.

  * #### (B) Amount of adjustment
    * The amount of the additional payment under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the applicable cutoff point under such subparagraph.

  * #### (C) Limit on aggregate outlier adjustments
    * #### (i) In general
      * The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.

    * #### (ii) Applicable percentage
      * For purposes of clause (i), the term "applicable percentage" means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)—

        * (I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and

        * (II) for 2004 and thereafter, 3.0 percent.

  * #### (D) Transitional authority
    * In applying subparagraph (A) for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002, the Secretary may—

      * (i) apply such subparagraph to a bill for such services related to an outpatient encounter (rather than for a specific service or group of services) using OPD fee schedule amounts and transitional pass-through payments covered under the bill; and

      * (ii) use an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio for the hospital involved (as determined by the Secretary), rather than for specific departments within the hospital.

  * #### (E) Exclusion of separate drug and biological APCS from outlier payments
    * No additional payment shall be made under subparagraph (A) in the case of ambulatory payment classification groups established separately for drugs or biologicals.

* #### (6) Transitional pass-through for additional costs of innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals
  * #### (A) In general
    * The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment under this paragraph for any of the following that are provided as part of a covered OPD service (or group of services):

    * #### (i) Current orphan drugs
      * A drug or biological that is used for a rare disease or condition with respect to which the drug or biological has been designated as an orphan drug under section 360bb of title 21 if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on the first date that the system under this subsection is implemented.

    * #### (ii) Current cancer therapy drugs and biologicals and brachytherapy
      * A drug or biological that is used in cancer therapy, including (but not limited to) a chemotherapeutic agent, an antiemetic, a hematopoietic growth factor, a colony stimulating factor, a biological response modifier, a bisphosphonate, and a device of brachytherapy or temperature monitored cryoablation, if payment for such drug, biological, or device as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

    * #### (iii) Current radiopharmaceutical drugs and biological products
      * A radiopharmaceutical drug or biological product used in diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

    * #### (iv) New medical devices, drugs, and biologicals
      * A medical device, drug, or biological not described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) if—
