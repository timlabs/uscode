* #### (5) Treatment of discounts
  * The payment rate reported by a laboratory under this subsection shall reflect all discounts, rebates, coupons, and other price concessions, including those described in section 1395w–3a(c)(3) of this title.

* #### (6) Ensuring complete reporting
  * In the case where an applicable laboratory has more than one payment rate for the same payor for the same test or more than one payment rate for different payors for the same test, the applicable laboratory shall report each such payment rate and the volume for the test at each such rate under this subsection. Beginning with January 1, 2019, the Secretary may establish rules to aggregate reporting with respect to the situations described in the preceding sentence.

* #### (7) Certification
  * An officer of the laboratory shall certify the accuracy and completeness of the information reported under this subsection.

    * The payment amounts established under this section shall apply to a clinical diagnostic laboratory test furnished by a hospital laboratory if such test is paid for separately, and not as part of a bundled payment under section 1395l(t) of this title.

* #### (2) Calculation of weighted median
  * For each laboratory test with respect to which information is reported under subsection (a) for a data collection period, the Secretary shall calculate a weighted median for the test for the period, by arraying the distribution of all payment rates reported for the period for each test weighted by volume for each payor and each laboratory.

* #### (3) Phase-in of reductions from private payor rate implementation
  * #### (A) In general
    * Payment amounts determined under this subsection for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for each of 2017 through 2024 shall not result in a reduction in payments for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for the year of greater than the applicable percent (as defined in subparagraph (B)) of the amount of payment for the test for the preceding year.

  * In the case of a sample collected from an individual in a skilled nursing facility or by a laboratory on behalf of a home health agency, the nominal fee that would otherwise apply under section 1395l(h)(3)(A) of this title shall be increased by $2.

#### (c) Payment for new tests that are not advanced diagnostic laboratory tests
* #### (1) Payment during initial period
  * In the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test that is assigned a new or substantially revised HCPCS code on or after April 1, 2014, and which is not an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (as defined in subsection (d)(5)), during an initial period until payment rates under subsection (b) are established for the test, payment for the test shall be determined—

    * (A) using cross-walking (as described in section 414.508(a) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation) to the most appropriate existing test under the fee schedule under this section during that period; or

    * In the case of an advanced diagnostic laboratory test for which payment has not been made under the fee schedule under section 1395l(h) of this title prior to April 1, 2014, during an initial period of three quarters, the payment amount for the test for such period shall be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test.

  * #### (B) Actual list charge
    * For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "actual list charge", with respect to a laboratory test furnished during such period, means the publicly available rate on the first day at which the test is available for purchase by a private payor.

* #### (2) Special rule for timing of initial reporting
  * With respect to an advanced diagnostic laboratory test described in paragraph (1)(A), an applicable laboratory shall initially be required to report under subsection (a) not later than the last day of the second quarter of the initial period under such paragraph.

* #### (3) Application of market rates after initial period
