The coverage period under this part of any such individual who (in the last month of his coverage period attributable to the State agreement or in any of the following six months) files notice that he no longer wishes to participate in the insurance program established by this part, shall terminate at the close of the month in which the notice is filed.

The agreement shall also contain such provisions as will facilitate the financial transactions of the State and the carrier with respect to deductions, coinsurance, and otherwise, and as will lead to economy and efficiency of operation, with respect to individuals receiving money payments under plans of the State approved under subchapters I, X, XIV, and XVI, and part A of subchapter IV, and individuals eligible to receive medical assistance under the plan of the State approved under subchapter XIX.

#### (g) Subsection (b) exclusions from coverage groups

* (2) In the case of any individual who would (but for this subsection) be excluded from the applicable coverage group described in subsection (b) by the second sentence of such subsection—

* (2) For purposes of this section, an individual shall be treated as eligible to receive medical assistance under the plan of the State approved under subchapter XIX if, for the month in which the modification is entered into under this subsection or for any month thereafter, he has been determined to be eligible to receive medical assistance under such plan. In the case of any individual who would (but for this subsection) be excluded from the agreement, subsections (c) and (d)(2) shall be applied as if they referred to the modification under this subsection (in lieu of the agreement under subsection (a)), and subsection (d)(2)(C) shall be applied (except in the case of qualified medicare beneficiaries, as defined in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title) by substituting "second month following the first month" for "first month".

* (3) In this subsection, the term "qualified medicare beneficiary" also includes an individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(E)(iii) of this title.
