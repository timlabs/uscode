* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall conduct a demonstration program (in this section referred to as the "demonstration program") to test a payment incentive and service delivery model that utilizes physician and nurse practitioner directed home-based primary care teams designed to reduce expenditures and improve health outcomes in the provision of items and services under this subchapter to applicable beneficiaries (as defined in subsection (d)).

* #### (2) Requirement
  * The demonstration program shall test whether a model described in paragraph (1), which is accountable for providing comprehensive, coordinated, continuous, and accessible care to high-need populations at home and coordinating health care across all treatment settings, results in—

    * (B) preventing hospital readmissions;

    * (C) reducing emergency room visits;

    * (D) improving health outcomes commensurate with the beneficiaries' stage of chronic illness;

    * (E) improving the efficiency of care, such as by reducing duplicative diagnostic and laboratory tests;

    * (F) reducing the cost of health care services covered under this subchapter; and

    * (G) achieving beneficiary and family caregiver satisfaction.

#### (b) Independence at home medical practice
* #### (1) Independence at home medical practice defined
  * In this section:

  * #### (A) In general
    * The term "independence at home medical practice" means a legal entity that—

      * (i) is comprised of an individual physician or nurse practitioner or group of physicians and nurse practitioners that provides care as part of a team that includes physicians, nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and other health and social services staff as appropriate who have experience providing home-based primary care to applicable beneficiaries, make in-home visits, and are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to carry out plans of care that are tailored to the individual beneficiary's chronic conditions and designed to achieve the results in subsection (a);

      * (ii) is organized at least in part for the purpose of providing physicians' services;

      * (iii) has documented experience in providing home-based primary care services to high-cost chronically ill beneficiaries, as determined appropriate by the Secretary;

      * (iv) furnishes services to at least 200 applicable beneficiaries (as defined in subsection (d)) during each year of the demonstration program;

      * (v) has entered into an agreement with the Secretary;

      * (vi) uses electronic health information systems, remote monitoring, and mobile diagnostic technology; and

      * (vii) meets such other criteria as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to participate in the demonstration program.


  * The entity shall report on quality measures (in such form, manner, and frequency as specified by the Secretary, which may be for the group, for providers of services and suppliers, or both) and report to the Secretary (in a form, manner, and frequency as specified by the Secretary) such data as the Secretary determines appropriate to monitor and evaluate the demonstration program.

  * #### (B) Physician
    * The term "physician" includes, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, any individual who furnishes services for which payment may be made as physicians' services and has the medical training or experience to fulfill the physician's role described in subparagraph (A)(i).

* #### (2) Participation of nurse practitioners and physician assistants
  * Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a nurse practitioner or physician assistant from participating in, or leading, a home-based primary care team as part of an independence at home medical practice if—

    * (A) all the requirements of this section are met;

    * (B) the nurse practitioner or physician assistant, as the case may be, is acting consistent with State law; and

    * (C) the nurse practitioner or physician assistant has the medical training or experience to fulfill the nurse practitioner or physician assistant role described in paragraph (1)(A)(i).

* #### (3) Inclusion of providers and practitioners
  * Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing an independence at home medical practice from including a provider of services or a participating practitioner described in section 1395u(b)(18)(C) of this title that is affiliated with the practice under an arrangement structured so that such provider of services or practitioner participates in the demonstration program and shares in any savings under the demonstration program.

* #### (4) Quality and performance standards
  * The Secretary shall develop quality performance standards for independence at home medical practices participating in the demonstration program.

#### (c) Payment methodology
* #### (1) Establishment of target spending level
  * The Secretary shall establish an estimated annual spending target, for the amount the Secretary estimates would have been spent in the absence of the demonstration, for items and services covered under parts A and B furnished to applicable beneficiaries for each qualifying independence at home medical practice under this section. Such spending targets shall be determined on a per capita basis. Such spending targets shall include a risk corridor that takes into account normal variation in expenditures for items and services covered under parts A and B furnished to such beneficiaries with the size of the corridor being related to the number of applicable beneficiaries furnished services by each independence at home medical practice. The spending targets may also be adjusted for other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.

* #### (2) Incentive payments
  * Subject to performance on quality measures, a qualifying independence at home medical practice is eligible to receive an incentive payment under this section if actual expenditures for a year for the applicable beneficiaries it enrolls are less than the estimated spending target established under paragraph (1) for such year. An incentive payment for such year shall be equal to a portion (as determined by the Secretary) of the amount by which actual expenditures (including incentive payments under this paragraph) for applicable beneficiaries under parts A and B for such year are estimated to be less than 5 percent less than the estimated spending target for such year, as determined under paragraph (1).

#### (d) Applicable beneficiaries
* #### (1) Definition

  * The Secretary shall determine an appropriate method of ensuring that applicable beneficiaries have agreed to enroll in an independence at home medical practice under the demonstration program. Enrollment in the demonstration program shall be voluntary.
