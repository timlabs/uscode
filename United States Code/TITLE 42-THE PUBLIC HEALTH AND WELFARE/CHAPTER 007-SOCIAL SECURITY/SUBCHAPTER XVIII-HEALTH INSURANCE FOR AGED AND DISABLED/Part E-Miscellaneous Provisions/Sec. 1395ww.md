### §1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
#### (a) Determination of costs for inpatient hospital services; limitations; exemptions; "operating costs of inpatient hospital services" defined
* (1)(A)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this subchapter with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) costs for the provision of such services by a hospital for a cost reporting period to the extent such costs exceed the applicable percentage (as determined under clause (ii)) of the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same grouping as such hospital for comparable time periods.

* (ii) For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage for hospital cost reporting periods beginning—

  * (I) on or after October 1, 1982, and before October 1, 1983, is 120 percent;

  * (II) on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, is 115 percent; and

  * (III) on or after October 1, 1984, is 110 percent.


* (B)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) the Secretary shall establish case mix indexes for all short-term hospitals, and shall set limits for each hospital based upon the general mix of types of medical cases with respect to which such hospital provides services for which payment may be made under this subchapter.

* (ii) The Secretary shall set such limits for a cost reporting period of a hospital—

  * (I) by updating available data for a previous period to the immediate preceding cost reporting period by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide, and

  * (II) by projecting for the cost reporting period by the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B)).


* (C) The limitation established under subparagraph (A) for any hospital shall in no event be lower than the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) recognized under this subchapter for such hospital for such hospital's last cost reporting period prior to the hospital's first cost reporting period for which this section is in effect.

* (D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983.

* (2) The Secretary shall provide for such exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, the limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) as he deems appropriate, including those which he deems necessary to take into account—

  * (A) the special needs of sole community hospitals, of new hospitals, of risk based health maintenance organizations, and of hospitals which provide atypical services or essential community services, and to take into account extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control, medical and paramedical education costs, significantly fluctuating population in the service area of the hospital, and unusual labor costs,

  * (B) the special needs of psychiatric hospitals and of public or other hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of patients who have low income or are entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and

  * (C) a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services.


* (3) The limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply with respect to any hospital which—

  * (A) is located outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area, and

  * (B)(i) has less than 50 beds, and

  * (ii) was in operation and had less than 50 beds on September 3, 1982.


* (4) For purposes of this section, the term "operating costs of inpatient hospital services" includes all routine operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services as such costs are determined on an average per admission or per discharge basis (as determined by the Secretary), and includes the costs of all services for which payment may be made under this subchapter that are provided by the hospital (or by an entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital) to the patient during the 3 days (or, in the case of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital, during the 1 day) immediately preceding the date of the patient's admission if such services are diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) or are other services related to the admission (as defined by the Secretary). Such term does not include costs of approved educational activities, a return on equity capital, other capital-related costs (as defined by the Secretary for periods before October 1, 1987), for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020, costs related to hematopoietic stem cell acquisition for the purpose of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (as described in subsection (d)(5)(M)), or costs with respect to administering blood clotting factors to individuals with hemophilia. In applying the first sentence of this paragraph, the term "other services related to the admission" includes all services that are not diagnostic services (other than ambulance and maintenance renal dialysis services) for which payment may be made under this subchapter that are provided by a hospital (or an entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital) to a patient—

  * (A) on the date of the patient's inpatient admission; or

  * (B) during the 3 days (or, in the case of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital, during the 1 day) immediately preceding the date of such admission unless the hospital demonstrates (in a form and manner, and at a time, specified by the Secretary) that such services are not related (as determined by the Secretary) to such admission.

#### (b) Computation of payment; definitions; exemptions; adjustments
* (1) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, if the operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) of a hospital (other than a subsection (d) hospital, as defined in subsection (d)(1)(B) and other than a rehabilitation facility described in subsection (j)(1)) for a cost reporting period subject to this paragraph—

  * (A) are less than or equal to the target amount (as defined in paragraph (3)) for that hospital for that period, the amount of the payment with respect to such operating costs payable under part A on a per discharge or per admission basis (as the case may be) shall be equal to the amount of such operating costs, plus—

    * (i) 15 percent of the amount by which the target amount exceeds the amount of the operating costs, or

    * (ii) 2 percent of the target amount,


* whichever is less;

  * (B) are greater than the target amount but do not exceed 110 percent of the target amount, the amount of the payment with respect to those operating costs payable under part A on a per discharge basis shall equal the target amount; or

  * (C) are greater than 110 percent of the target amount, the amount of the payment with respect to such operating costs payable under part A on a per discharge or per admission basis (as the case may be) shall be equal to (i) the target amount, plus (ii) in the case of cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the amount by which the operating costs exceed 110 percent of the target amount (except that such additional amount may not exceed 10 percent of the target amount) after any exceptions or adjustments are made to such target amount for the cost reporting period;


* plus the amount, if any, provided under paragraph (2), except that in no case may the amount payable under this subchapter (other than on the basis of a DRG prospective payment rate determined under subsection (d)) with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services exceed the maximum amount payable with respect to such costs pursuant to subsection (a).

* (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), in addition to the payment computed under paragraph (1), in the case of an eligible hospital (described in subparagraph (B)) for a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the amount of payment on a per discharge basis under paragraph (1) shall be increased by the lesser of—

  * (i) 50 percent of the amount by which the operating costs are less than the expected costs (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the period; or

  * (ii) 1 percent of the target amount for the period.


* (B) For purposes of this paragraph, an "eligible hospital" means with respect to a cost reporting period, a hospital—

  * (i) that has received payments under this subsection for at least 3 full cost reporting periods before that cost reporting period, and

  * (ii) whose operating costs for the period are less than the least of its target amount, its trended costs (as defined in subparagraph (C)), or its expected costs (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the period.


* (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii), the term "trended costs" means for a hospital cost reporting period ending in a fiscal year—

  * (i) in the case of a hospital for which its cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1996 was its third or subsequent full cost reporting period for which it receives payments under this subsection, the lesser of the operating costs or target amount for that hospital for its cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1996, or

  * (ii) in the case of any other hospital, the operating costs for that hospital for its third full cost reporting period for which it receives payments under this subsection,


* increased (in a compounded manner) for each succeeding fiscal year (through the fiscal year involved) by the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year.

* (D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "expected costs", with respect to the cost reporting period ending in a fiscal year, means the lesser of the operating costs of inpatient hospital services or target amount per discharge for the previous cost reporting period updated by the market basket percentage increase (as defined in paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) for the fiscal year.

* (E)(i) In the case of an eligible hospital that is a hospital or unit that is within a class of hospital described in clause (ii) with a 12-month cost reporting period beginning before November 29, 1999, in determining the amount of the increase under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall substitute for the percentage of the target amount applicable under subparagraph (A)(ii)—

  * (I) for a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2000, and before September 30, 2001, 1.5 percent; and

* (VIII) Effective for payments beginning with fiscal year 2013, with respect to quality measures for outcomes of care, the Secretary shall provide for such risk adjustment as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to maintain incentives for hospitals to treat patients with severe illnesses or conditions.

* (IX)(aa) Subject to item (bb), effective for payments beginning with fiscal year 2013, each measure specified by the Secretary under this clause shall be endorsed by the entity with a contract under section 1395aaa(a) of this title.

* (bb) In the case of a specified area or medical topic determined appropriate by the Secretary for which a feasible and practical measure has not been endorsed by the entity with a contract under section 1395aaa(a) of this title, the Secretary may specify a measure that is not so endorsed as long as due consideration is given to measures that have been endorsed or adopted by a consensus organization identified by the Secretary.

  * (bb) other providers of services and suppliers under this subchapter.


* (XI) The Secretary shall establish a process to validate measures specified under this clause as appropriate. Such process shall include the auditing of a number of randomly selected hospitals sufficient to ensure validity of the reporting program under this clause as a whole and shall provide a hospital with an opportunity to appeal the validation of measures reported by such hospital.

* (XII)(aa) With respect to a Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey (or a successor survey) conducted on or after January 1, 2020, such survey may not include questions about communication by hospital staff with an individual about such individual's pain unless such questions take into account, as applicable, whether an individual experiencing pain was informed about risks associated with the use of opioids and about non-opioid alternatives for the treatment of pain.

* (bb) The Secretary shall not include on the Hospital Compare internet website any measures based on the questions appearing on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey in 2018 or 2019 about communication by hospital staff with an individual about such individual's pain.

* (ix)(I) For purposes of clause (i) for fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year, in the case of an eligible hospital (as defined in subsection (n)(6)) that is not a meaningful EHR user (as defined in subsection (n)(3)) for an EHR reporting period for such fiscal year, three-quarters of the applicable percentage increase otherwise applicable under clause (i) (determined without regard to clause (viii), (xi), or (xii)) for such fiscal year shall be reduced by 331/3 percent for fiscal year 2015, 662/3 percent for fiscal year 2016, and 100 percent for fiscal year 2017 and each subsequent fiscal year. Such reduction shall apply only with respect to the fiscal year involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing the applicable percentage increase under clause (i) for a subsequent fiscal year.

* (II) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis (and, with respect to the application of subclause (I) for fiscal year 2017, for categories of subsection (d) hospitals, as established by the Secretary and posted on the Internet website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services prior to December 15, 2015, an application for which must be submitted to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 2016), exempt an eligible hospital from the application of subclause (I) with respect to a fiscal year if the Secretary determines, subject to annual renewal, that requiring such hospital to be a meaningful EHR user during such fiscal year would result in a significant hardship, such as in the case of a hospital in a rural area without sufficient Internet access. The Secretary shall exempt an eligible hospital from the application of the payment adjustment under subclause (I) with respect to a fiscal year, subject to annual renewal, if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user is not possible because the certified EHR technology used by such hospital is decertified under a program kept or recognized pursuant to section 300jj–11(c)(5) of this title. In no case may a hospital be granted an exemption under this subclause for more than 5 years.

* (III) For fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year, a State in which hospitals are paid for services under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title shall adjust the payments to each subsection (d) hospital in the State that is not a meaningful EHR user (as defined in subsection (n)(3)) in a manner that is designed to result in an aggregate reduction in payments to hospitals in the State that is equivalent to the aggregate reduction that would have occurred if payments had been reduced to each subsection (d) hospital in the State in a manner comparable to the reduction under the previous provisions of this clause. The State shall report to the Secretary the methodology it will use to make the payment adjustment under the previous sentence.

* (IV) For purposes of this clause, the term "EHR reporting period" means, with respect to a fiscal year, any period (or periods) as specified by the Secretary.

* (x)(I) The Secretary shall develop standard Internet website reports tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders such as hospitals, patients, researchers, and policymakers. The Secretary shall seek input from such stakeholders in determining the type of information that is useful and the formats that best facilitate the use of the information.

* (II) The Secretary shall modify the Hospital Compare Internet website to make the use and navigation of that website readily available to individuals accessing it.

* (xi)(I) For 2012 and each subsequent fiscal year, after determining the applicable percentage increase described in clause (i) and after application of clauses (viii) and (ix), such percentage increase shall be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in subclause (II).

* (II) The productivity adjustment described in this subclause, with respect to a percentage, factor, or update for a fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period, is a productivity adjustment equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity (as projected by the Secretary for the 10-year period ending with the applicable fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period).

* (III) The application of subclause (I) may result in the applicable percentage increase described in clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this section for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

* (xii) After determining the applicable percentage increase described in clause (i), and after application of clauses (viii), (ix), and (xi), the Secretary shall reduce such applicable percentage increase—

  * (I) for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011, by 0.25 percentage point;

  * (II) for each of fiscal years 2012 and 2013, by 0.1 percentage point;

  * (III) for fiscal year 2014, by 0.3 percentage point;

  * (IV) for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2016, by 0.2 percentage point; and

  * (V) for each of fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, by 0.75 percentage point.


* The application of this clause may result in the applicable percentage increase described in clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this section for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

* (C) In the case of a hospital that is a sole community hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(D)(iii)), subject to subparagraphs (I) and (L), the term "target amount" means—

  * (i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital—

    * (I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the "base cost reporting period") preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by—

    * (II) the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period,


  * (ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period beginning before fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv) for discharges occurring in the fiscal year in which that later cost reporting period begins,

  * (iii) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1993 increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv), or

  * (iv) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1995 and each subsequent fiscal year, the target amount for the preceding year increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv).


* There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

* (D) For cost reporting periods ending on or before September 30, 1994, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2022, in the case of a hospital that is a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(G)), subject to subparagraph (K), the term "target amount" means—

  * (i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital—

    * (I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the "base cost reporting period") preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by—

    * (II) the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period, or


  * (ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period beginning before fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv) for discharges occurring in the fiscal year in which that later cost reporting period begins,

  * (iii) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1993 increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv), and

  * (iv) with respect to discharges occurring during fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2022, the target amount for the preceding year increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv).


* There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

* (E) In the case of a hospital described in clause (v) of subsection (d)(1)(B), the term "target amount" means—

  * (i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital—

    * (I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the "base cost reporting period") preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by—

    * (II) the sum of the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period, or


  * (ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(ii) for that later cost reporting period.


* There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

* (F)(i) In the case of a hospital (or unit described in the matter following clause (v) of subsection (d)(1)(B)) that received payment under this subsection for inpatient hospital services furnished during cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1990, that is within a class of hospital described in clause (iii), and that elects (in a form and manner determined by the Secretary) this subparagraph to apply to the hospital, the target amount for the hospital's 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998 is equal to the average described in clause (ii).

* (ii) The average described in this clause for a hospital or unit shall be determined by the Secretary as follows:

  * (I) The Secretary shall determine the allowable operating costs for inpatient hospital services for the hospital or unit for each of the 5 cost reporting periods for which the Secretary has the most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 1997.

  * (IV) Hospitals described in clause (iv) of such subsection.

  * (V) Hospitals described in clause (v) of such subsection.


* (G)(i) In the case of a qualified long-term care hospital (as defined in clause (ii)) that elects (in a form and manner determined by the Secretary) this subparagraph to apply to the hospital, the target amount for the hospital's 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998 is equal to the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1996, increased by the applicable percentage increase for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1997.

* (ii) In clause (i), a "qualified long-term care hospital" means, with respect to a cost reporting period, a hospital described in clause (iv) of subsection (d)(1)(B) during each of the 2 cost reporting periods for which the Secretary has the most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 1997, for each of which—

  * (I) the hospital's allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services recognized under this subchapter exceeded 115 percent of the hospital's target amount, and

  * (II) the hospital would have a disproportionate patient percentage of at least 70 percent (as determined by the Secretary under subsection (d)(5)(F)(vi)) if the hospital were a subsection (d) hospital.


* (H)(i) In the case of a hospital or unit that is within a class of hospital described in clause (iv), for a cost reporting period beginning during fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the target amount for such a hospital or unit may not exceed the amount as updated up to or for such cost reporting period under clause (ii).

* (ii)(I) In the case of a hospital or unit that is within a class of hospital described in clause (iv), the Secretary shall estimate the 75th percentile of the target amounts for such hospitals within such class for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1996, as adjusted under clause (iii).

* (II) The Secretary shall update the amount determined under subclause (I), for each cost reporting period after the cost reporting period described in such subclause and up to the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, by a factor equal to the market basket percentage increase.

* (III) For cost reporting periods beginning during each of fiscal years 1999 through 2002, subject to subparagraph (J), the Secretary shall update such amount by a factor equal to the market basket percentage increase.

* (iii) In applying clause (ii)(I) in the case of a hospital or unit, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to the labor-related portion of the amount determined under such subparagraph to take into account differences between average wage-related costs in the area of the hospital and the national average of such costs within the same class of hospital.

* (iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, each of the following shall be treated as a separate class of hospital:

  * (I) Hospitals described in clause (i) of subsection (d)(1)(B) and psychiatric units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

  * (II) Hospitals described in clause (ii) of such subsection and rehabilitation units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

  * (III) Hospitals described in clause (iv) of such subsection.


* (I)(i) Subject to subparagraph (L), for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2000, in the case of a sole community hospital there shall be substituted for the amount otherwise determined under subsection (d)(5)(D)(i), if such substitution results in a greater amount of payment under this section for the hospital—

  * (I) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 2001, 75 percent of the amount otherwise applicable to the hospital under subsection (d)(5)(D)(i) (referred to in this clause as the "subsection (d)(5)(D)(i) amount") and 25 percent of the rebased target amount (as defined in clause (ii));

  * (IV) with respect to discharges occurring after fiscal year 2003, 100 percent of the rebased target amount.


* (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the "rebased target amount" has the meaning given the term "target amount" in subparagraph (C) except that—

  * (I) there shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1996;

  * (II) any reference in subparagraph (C)(i) to the "first cost reporting period" described in such subparagraph is deemed a reference to the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2000; and

  * (III) applicable increase percentage shall only be applied under subparagraph (C)(iv) for discharges occurring in fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2002.


* (iii) In no case shall a hospital be denied treatment as a sole community hospital or payment (on the basis of a target rate as such as a hospital) because data are unavailable for any cost reporting period due to changes in ownership, changes in fiscal intermediaries, or other extraordinary circumstances, so long as data for at least one applicable base cost reporting period is available.

* (J) For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2001, for a hospital described in subsection (d)(1)(B)(iv)—

  * (i) the limiting or cap amount otherwise determined under subparagraph (H) shall be increased by 2 percent; and

* (ii) This subparagraph shall only apply to a hospital if the substitution described in clause (i)(I) results in an increase in the target amount under subparagraph (D) for the hospital.

* (L)(i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the case of a sole community hospital there shall be substituted for the amount otherwise determined under subsection (d)(5)(D)(i) of this section, if such substitution results in a greater amount of payment under this section for the hospital, the subparagraph (L) rebased target amount.

* (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "subparagraph (L) rebased target amount" has the meaning given the term "target amount" in subparagraph (C), except that—

  * (I) there shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2006;

  * (II) any reference in subparagraph (C)(i) to the "first cost reporting period" described in such subparagraph is deemed a reference to the first cost reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2009; and

  * (III) the applicable percentage increase shall only be applied under subparagraph (C)(iv) for discharges occurring on or after January 1, 2009.


* (4)(A)(i) The Secretary shall provide for an exception and adjustment to (and in the case of a hospital described in subsection (d)(1)(B)(iii), may provide an exemption from) the method under this subsection for determining the amount of payment to a hospital where events beyond the hospital's control or extraordinary circumstances, including changes in the case mix of such hospital, create a distortion in the increase in costs for a cost reporting period (including any distortion in the costs for the base period against which such increase is measured). The Secretary may provide for such other exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, such method as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the assignment of a new base period which is more representative, as determined by the Secretary, of the reasonable and necessary cost of inpatient services and including those which he deems necessary to take into account a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services. The Secretary shall announce a decision on any request for an exemption, exception, or adjustment under this paragraph not later than 180 days after receiving a completed application from the intermediary for such exemption, exception, or adjustment, and shall include in such decision a detailed explanation of the grounds on which such request was approved or denied.

* (ii) The payment reductions under paragraph (3)(B)(ii)(V) shall not be considered by the Secretary in making adjustments pursuant to clause (i). In making such reductions, the Secretary shall treat the applicable update factor described in paragraph (3)(B)(vi) for a fiscal year as being equal to the market basket percentage for that year.

* (B) In determining under subparagraph (A) whether to assign a new base period which is more representative of the reasonable and necessary cost to a hospital of providing inpatient services, the Secretary shall take into consideration—

  * (i) changes in applicable technologies and medical practices, or differences in the severity of illness among patients, that increase the hospital's costs;

  * (ii) whether increases in wages and wage-related costs for hospitals located in the geographic area in which the hospital is located exceed the average of the increases in such costs paid by hospitals in the United States; and

  * (iii) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in determining increases in the hospital's costs of providing inpatient services.


* (C) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to payment of hospitals which is otherwise determined under paragraph (3) of section 1395f(b) of this title.

* (5) In the case of any hospital having any cost reporting period of other than a 12-month period, the Secretary shall determine the 12-month period which shall be used for purposes of this section.

* (6) In the case of any hospital which becomes subject to the taxes under section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to any or all of its employees, for part or all of a cost reporting period, and was not subject to such taxes with respect to any or all of its employees for all or part of the 12-month base cost reporting period referred to in subsection (b)(3)(A)(i), the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment by increasing the base period amount described in such subsection for such hospital by an amount equal to the amount of such taxes which would have been paid or accrued by such hospital for such base period if such hospital had been subject to such taxes for all of such base period with respect to all its employees, minus the amount of any such taxes actually paid or accrued for such base period.

* (7)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the case of a hospital or unit that is within a class of hospital described in subparagraph (B) which first receives payments under this section on or after October 1, 1997—

  * (i) for each of the first 2 cost reporting periods for which the hospital has a settled cost report, the amount of the payment with respect to operating costs described in paragraph (1) under part A on a per discharge or per admission basis (as the case may be) is equal to the lesser of—

    * (I) the amount of operating costs for such respective period, or

    * (II) 110 percent of the national median (as estimated by the Secretary) of the target amount for hospitals in the same class as the hospital for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1996, updated by the hospital market basket increase percentage to the fiscal year in which the hospital first received payments under this section, as adjusted under subparagraph (C); and


  * (ii) for purposes of computing the target amount for the subsequent cost reporting period, the target amount for the preceding cost reporting period is equal to the amount determined under clause (i) for such preceding period.


* (B) For purposes of this paragraph, each of the following shall be treated as a separate class of hospital:

  * (i) Hospitals described in clause (i) of subsection (d)(1)(B) and psychiatric units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

  * (ii) Hospitals described in clause (ii) of such subsection and rehabilitation units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

  * (iii) Hospitals described in clause (iv) of such subsection.


* (C) In applying subparagraph (A)(i)(II) in the case of a hospital or unit, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to the labor-related portion of the amount determined under such subparagraph to take into account differences between average wage-related costs in the area of the hospital and the national average of such costs within the same class of hospital.

#### (c) Payment in accordance with State hospital reimbursement control system; amount of payment; discontinuance of payments
* (1) The Secretary may provide, in his discretion, that payment with respect to services provided by a hospital in a State may be made in accordance with a hospital reimbursement control system in a State, rather than in accordance with the other provisions of this subchapter, if the chief executive officer of the State requests such treatment and if—

  * (A) the Secretary determines that the system, if approved under this subsection, will apply (i) to substantially all non-Federal acute care hospitals (as defined by the Secretary) in the State and (ii) to the review of at least 75 percent of all revenues or expenses in the State for inpatient hospital services and of revenues or expenses for inpatient hospital services provided under the State's plan approved under subchapter XIX;

  * (B) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances as to the equitable treatment under the system of all entities (including Federal and State programs) that pay hospitals for inpatient hospital services, of hospital employees, and of hospital patients;

  * (C) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances that under the system, over 36-month periods (the first such period beginning with the first month in which this subsection applies to that system in the State), the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system will not exceed the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system;

  * (D) the Secretary determines that the system will not preclude an eligible organization (as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title) from negotiating directly with hospitals with respect to the organization's rate of payment for inpatient hospital services; and

  * (E) the Secretary determines that the system requires hospitals to meet the requirement of section 1395cc(a)(1)(G) of this title and the system provides for the exclusion of certain costs in accordance with section 1395y(a)(14) of this title (except for such waivers thereof as the Secretary provides by regulation).


* The Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's hospital reimbursement control system is based on a payment methodology other than on the basis of a diagnosis-related group or on the ground that the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system must be less than the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining payment amounts at no more than a specified percentage increase above the payment amounts in a base period, the State has the option of applying such test (for inpatient hospital services under part A) on an aggregate payment basis or on the basis of the amount of payment per inpatient discharge or admission. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining aggregate payment amounts below a national average percentage increase in total payments under part A for inpatient hospital services, the Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's rate of increase in such payments for such services must be less than such national average rate of increase.

* (2) In determining under paragraph (1)(C) the amount of payment which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter for a State, the Secretary may provide for appropriate adjustment of such amount to take into account previous reductions effected in the amount of payments made under this subchapter in the State due to the operation of the hospital reimbursement control system in the State if the system has resulted in an aggregate rate of increase in operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) under this subchapter for hospitals in the State which is less than the aggregate rate of increase in such costs under this subchapter for hospitals in the United States.

* (3) The Secretary shall discontinue payments under a system described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary—

  * (A) determines that the system no longer meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (5), or

  * (B) has reason to believe that the assurances described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) (or, if applicable, in paragraph (5)) are not being (or will not be) met.


* (4) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if—

  * (A) the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) have been met with respect to the system, and

  * (B) with respect to that system a waiver of certain requirements of this subchapter has been approved on or before (and which is in effect as of) April 20, 1983, pursuant to section 1395b–1(a) of this title or section 222(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972.


* With respect to a State system described in this paragraph, the Secretary shall judge the effectiveness of such system on the basis of its rate of increase or inflation in inpatient hospital payments for individuals under this subchapter, as compared to the national rate of increase or inflation for such payments, with the State retaining the option to have the test applied on the basis of the aggregate payments under the State system as compared to aggregate payments which would have been made under the national system since October 1, 1984, to the most recent date for which annual data are available.

* (5) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if—

  * (A) the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) have been met with respect to the system;

  * (B) the Secretary determines that the system—

    * (i) is operated directly by the State or by an entity designated pursuant to State law,

    * (ii) provides for payment of hospitals covered under the system under a methodology (which sets forth exceptions and adjustments, as well as any method for changes in the methodology) by which rates or amounts to be paid for hospital services during a specified period are established under the system prior to the defined rate period, and

    * (iii) hospitals covered under the system will make such reports (in lieu of cost and other reports, identified by the Secretary, otherwise required under this subchapter) as the Secretary may require in order to properly monitor assurances provided under this subsection;


  * (C) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that operation of the system will not result in any change in hospital admission practices which result in—

    * (i) a significant reduction in the proportion of patients (receiving hospital services covered under the system) who have no third-party coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services,

    * (ii) a significant reduction in the proportion of individuals admitted to hospitals for inpatient hospital services for which payment is (or is likely to be) less than the anticipated charges for or costs of such services,

    * (iii) the refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital, or

    * (iv) the refusal to provide emergency services to any person who is in need of emergency services if the hospital provides such services;


  * (D) any change by the State in the system which has the effect of materially reducing payments to hospitals can only take effect upon 60 days notice to the Secretary and to the hospitals the payment to which is likely to be materially affected by the change; and

  * (E) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that in the development of the system the State has consulted with local governmental officials concerning the impact of the system on public hospitals.


* The Secretary shall respond to requests of States under this paragraph within 60 days of the date the request is submitted to the Secretary.

* (6) If the Secretary determines that the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) have not been met with respect to any 36-month period, the Secretary may reduce payments under this subchapter to hospitals under the system in an amount equal to the amount by which the payment under this subchapter under such system for such period exceeded the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system.

* (7) In the case of a State which made a request under paragraph (5) before December 31, 1984, for the approval of a State hospital reimbursement control system and which request was approved—

  * (A) in applying paragraphs (1)(C) and (6), a reference to a "36-month period" is deemed a reference to a "48-month period", and

  * (B) in order to allow the State the opportunity to provide the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) for a 48-month period, the Secretary may not discontinue payments under the system, under the authority of paragraph (3)(A) because the Secretary has reason to believe that such assurances are not being (or will not be) met, before July 1, 1986.

#### (d) Inpatient hospital service payments on basis of prospective rates; Medicare Geographical Classification Review Board
* (1)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) of a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for inpatient hospital discharges in a cost reporting period or in a fiscal year—

  * (i) beginning on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, is equal to the sum of—

    * (I) the target percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section, but determined without the application of subsection (a)), and

    * (II) the DRG percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (2) for such discharges;


  * (ii) beginning on or after October 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1987, is equal to the sum of—

    * (II) the DRG percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the applicable combined adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under subparagraph (D) for such discharges; or


  * (iii) beginning on or after April 1, 1988, is equal to—

    * (I) the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges, or

    * (II) for discharges occurring during a fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1996, the sum of 85 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges and 15 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under such paragraph, but only if the average standardized amount (described in clause (i)(I) or clause (ii)(I) of paragraph (3)(D)) for hospitals within the region of, and in the same large urban or other area (or, for discharges occurring during a fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1994, the same large urban or other area) as, the hospital is greater than the average standardized amount (described in the respective clause) for hospitals within the United States in that type of area for discharges occurring during such fiscal year.


* (B) As used in this section, the term "subsection (d) hospital" means a hospital located in one of the fifty States or the District of Columbia other than—

  * (i) a psychiatric hospital (as defined in section 1395x(f) of this title),

  * (ii) a rehabilitation hospital (as defined by the Secretary),

* and, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, does not include a psychiatric or rehabilitation unit of the hospital which is a distinct part of the hospital (as defined by the Secretary). A hospital that was classified by the Secretary on or before September 30, 1995, as a hospital described in clause (iv) (as in effect as of such date) shall continue to be so classified (or, in the case of a hospital described in clause (iv)(II), as so in effect, shall be classified under clause (vi) on and after the effective date of such clause (vi) and for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, shall not be subject to subsection (m) as of the date of such classification) notwithstanding that it is located in the same building as, or on the same campus as, another hospital.

* (D) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), the "applicable combined adjusted DRG prospective payment rate" for discharges occurring—

  * (i) on or after October 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1986, is a combined rate consisting of 25 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, and 75 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges; and

  * (ii) on or after October 1, 1986, and before October 1, 1987, is a combined rate consisting of 50 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, and 50 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges.


* (E) For purposes of subclauses (II) and (III) of subparagraph (B)(v) only, the term "principal finding of neoplastic disease" means the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of a patient to a hospital, except that only discharges with ICD–9–CM principal diagnosis codes of 140 through 239, V58.0, V58.1, V66.1, V66.2, or 990 will be considered to reflect such a principal diagnosis.

* (2) The Secretary shall determine a national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital in the United States, and shall determine a regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for such discharges in each region, for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Each such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within the United States or within each such region, respectively, as follows:

  * (A) DETERMINING ALLOWABLE INDIVIDUAL HOSPITAL COSTS FOR BASE PERIOD.—The Secretary shall determine the allowable operating costs per discharge of inpatient hospital services for the hospital for the most recent cost reporting period for which data are available.

  * (B) UPDATING FOR FISCAL YEAR 1984.—The Secretary shall update each amount determined under subparagraph (A) for fiscal year 1984 by—

    * (i) updating for fiscal year 1983 by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide between the cost reporting period used under such subparagraph and fiscal year 1983 and the most recent case-mix data available, and

    * (ii) projecting for fiscal year 1984 by the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B)) for fiscal year 1984.


  * (C) STANDARDIZING AMOUNTS.—The Secretary shall standardize the amount updated under subparagraph (B) for each hospital by—

    * (i) excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs (taking into account, for discharges occurring after September 30, 1986, the amendments made by section 9104(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985), except that the Secretary shall not take into account any reduction in the amount of additional payments under paragraph (5)(B)(ii) resulting from the amendment made by section 4621(a)(1) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 or any additional payments under such paragraph resulting from the application of section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, of section 302 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, or the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003,

    * (ii) adjusting for variations among hospitals by area in the average hospital wage level,

    * (iii) adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals, and

    * (iv) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, excluding an estimate of the additional payments to certain hospitals to be made under paragraph (5)(F), except that the Secretary shall not exclude additional payments under such paragraph made as a result of the enactment of section 6003(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, the enactment of section 4002(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the enactment of section 303 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, or the enactment of section 402(a)(1) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.


  * (D) COMPUTING URBAN AND RURAL AVERAGES.—The Secretary shall compute an average of the standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for the United States and for each region—

    * (i) for all subsection (d) hospitals located in an urban area within the United States or that region, respectively, and

    * (ii) for all subsection (d) hospitals located in a rural area within the United States or that region, respectively.


* For purposes of this subsection, the term "region" means one of the nine census divisions, comprising the fifty States and the District of Columbia, established by the Bureau of the Census for statistical and reporting purposes; the term "urban area" means an area within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget) or within such similar area as the Secretary has recognized under subsection (a) by regulation; the term "large urban area" means, with respect to a fiscal year, such an urban area which the Secretary determines (in the publications described in subsection (e)(5) before the fiscal year) has a population of more than 1,000,000 (as determined by the Secretary based on the most recent available population data published by the Bureau of the Census); and the term "rural area" means any area outside such an area or similar area. A hospital located in a Metropolitan Statistical Area shall be deemed to be located in the region in which the largest number of the hospitals in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area are located, or, at the option of the Secretary, the region in which the majority of the inpatient discharges (with respect to which payments are made under this subchapter) from hospitals in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area are made.

  * (E) REDUCING FOR VALUE OF OUTLIER PAYMENTS.—The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (D) by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this subsection based on DRG prospective payment rates which are additional payments described in paragraph (5)(A) (relating to outlier payments).

  * (F) MAINTAINING BUDGET NEUTRALITY.—The Secretary shall adjust each of such average standardized amounts as may be required under subsection (e)(1)(B) for that fiscal year.

  * (G) COMPUTING DRG-SPECIFIC RATES FOR URBAN AND RURAL HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN EACH REGION.—For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall establish a national DRG prospective payment rate and shall establish a regional DRG prospective payment rate for each region, each of which is equal—

    * (i) for hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of—

      * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (D), reduced under subparagraph (E), and adjusted under subparagraph (F)) for hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or that region, and

      * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group; and


    * (ii) for hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of—

      * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (D), reduced under subparagraph (E), and adjusted under subparagraph (F)) for hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or that region, and

      * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.


  * (H) ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENT AREA WAGE LEVELS.—The Secretary shall adjust the proportion, (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the national and regional DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (G) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.


* (3) The Secretary shall determine a national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in a fiscal year after fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital in the United States, and shall determine, for fiscal years before fiscal year 1997, a regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for such discharges in each region for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Each such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in large urban, other urban, or rural areas within the United States and within each such region, respectively, as follows:

  * (A) UPDATING PREVIOUS STANDARDIZED AMOUNTS.—(i) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within the United States and for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within each region, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under paragraph (2)(D) or under this subparagraph, increased for the fiscal year involved by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B). With respect to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute urban and rural averages on the basis of discharge weighting rather than hospital weighting, making appropriate adjustments to ensure that computation on such basis does not result in total payments under this section that are greater or less than the total payments that would have been made under this section but for this sentence, and making appropriate changes in the manner of determining the reductions under subparagraph (C)(ii).

  * (ii) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1987, and ending on or before September 30, 1994, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area, for hospitals located in a rural area, and for hospitals located in other urban areas, within the United States and within each region, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.

  * (iii) For discharges occurring in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1994, the average standardized amount for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall adjust the ratio of the labor portion to non-labor portion of each average standardized amount to equal such ratio for the national average of all standardized amounts.

  * (iv)(I) Subject to subclause (II), for discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1995, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area and for hospitals located in other areas within the United States and within each region equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.

  * (II) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2004), the Secretary shall compute a standardized amount for hospitals located in any area within the United States and within each region equal to the standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph for hospitals located in a large urban area (or, beginning with fiscal year 2005, for all hospitals in the previous fiscal year) increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) for the fiscal year involved.

  * (v) Average standardized amounts computed under this paragraph shall be adjusted to reflect the most recent case-mix data available.

  * (vi) Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under paragraph (4)(C)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust the average standardized amounts computed under this paragraph for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

  * (B) REDUCING FOR VALUE OF OUTLIER PAYMENTS.—The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (A) by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on DRG prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (5)(A) (relating to outlier payments).

  * (C) MAINTAINING BUDGET NEUTRALITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 1985.—(i) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall adjust each of such average standardized amounts as may be required under subsection (e)(1)(B) for that fiscal year.

  * (ii) REDUCING FOR SAVINGS FROM AMENDMENT TO INDIRECT TEACHING ADJUSTMENT FOR DISCHARGES AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 1986.—For discharges occurring after September 30, 1986, the Secretary shall further reduce each of the average standardized amounts (in a proportion which takes into account the differing effects of the standardization effected under paragraph (2)(C)(i)) so as to provide for a reduction in the total of the payments (attributable to this paragraph) made for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, of an amount equal to the estimated reduction in the payment amounts under paragraph (5)(B) that would have resulted from the enactment of the amendments made by section 9104 of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985 and by section 4003(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 if the factor described in clause (ii)(II) of paragraph (5)(B) (determined without regard to amendments made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) were applied for discharges occurring on or after such date instead of the factor described in clause (ii) of that paragraph.

  * (D) COMPUTING DRG-SPECIFIC RATES FOR HOSPITALS.—For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall establish for the fiscal year a national DRG prospective payment rate and shall establish, for fiscal years before fiscal year 1997, a regional DRG prospective payment rate for each region which is equal—

    * (i) for fiscal years before fiscal year 2004, for hospitals located in a large urban area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of—

      * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (A), reduced under subparagraph (B), and adjusted or reduced under subparagraph (C)) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in such a large urban area in the United States or that region, and

      * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group;


    * (ii) for fiscal years before fiscal year 2004, for hospitals located in other areas in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of—

      * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (A), reduced under subparagraph (B), and adjusted or reduced under subparagraph (C)) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in other areas in the United States or that region, and

      * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group; and


    * (iii) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2003, for hospitals located in all areas, to the product of—

      * (I) the applicable standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (A)), reduced under subparagraph (B), and adjusted or reduced under subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year; and

      * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.


  * (E) ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENT AREA WAGE LEVELS.—

    * (i) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in clause (ii) or (iii), the Secretary shall adjust the proportion, (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (D) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level. Not later than October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1993 (and at least every 12 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals in the United States. Not less often than once every 3 years the Secretary (through such survey or otherwise) shall measure the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category and shall exclude data with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing skilled nursing facility services. Any adjustments or updates made under this subparagraph for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment. The Secretary shall apply the previous sentence for any period as if the amendments made by section 403(a)(1) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the amendments made by section 10324(a)(1) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had not been enacted.

    * (ii) ALTERNATIVE PROPORTION TO BE ADJUSTED BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.—For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, the Secretary shall substitute "62 percent" for the proportion described in the first sentence of clause (i), unless the application of this clause would result in lower payments to a hospital than would otherwise be made.

    * (iii) FLOOR ON AREA WAGE INDEX FOR HOSPITALS IN FRONTIER STATES.—

      * (I) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subclause (IV), for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010, the area wage index applicable under this subparagraph to any hospital which is located in a frontier State (as defined in subclause (II)) may not be less than 1.00.

      * (II) FRONTIER STATE DEFINED.—In this clause, the term "frontier State" means a State in which at least 50 percent of the counties in the State are frontier counties.

      * (III) FRONTIER COUNTY DEFINED.—In this clause, the term "frontier county" means a county in which the population per square mile is less than 6.

      * (IV) LIMITATION.—This clause shall not apply to any hospital located in a State that receives a non-labor related share adjustment under paragraph (5)(H).


* (4)(A) The Secretary shall establish a classification of inpatient hospital discharges by diagnosis-related groups and a methodology for classifying specific hospital discharges within these groups.

* (B) For each such diagnosis-related group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting factor which reflects the relative hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.

* (C)(i) The Secretary shall adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under subparagraphs (A) and (B), for discharges in fiscal year 1988 and at least annually thereafter, to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology (including a new medical service or technology under paragraph (5)(K)), and other factors which may change the relative use of hospital resources.

* (ii) For discharges in fiscal year 1990, the Secretary shall reduce the weighting factor for each diagnosis-related group by 1.22 percent.

* (iii) Any such adjustment under clause (i) for discharges in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) or payments under paragraph (5)(M) (beginning with fiscal year 2021) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection for discharges in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made for discharges in the year without such adjustment or payments under paragraph (5)(M).

* (iv)(I) For discharges occurring during the emergency period described in section 1320b–5(g)(1)(B) of this title, in the case of a discharge of an individual diagnosed with COVID–19, the Secretary shall increase the weighting factor that would otherwise apply to the diagnosis-related group to which the discharge is assigned by 20 percent. The Secretary shall identify a discharge of such an individual through the use of diagnosis codes, condition codes, or other such means as may be necessary.

* (II) Any adjustment under subclause (I) shall not be taken into account in applying budget neutrality under clause (iii)

* (III) In the case of a State for which the Secretary has waived all or part of this section under the authority of section 1315a of this title, nothing in this section shall preclude such State from implementing an adjustment similar to the adjustment under subclause (I).

* (D)(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, the diagnosis-related group to be assigned under this paragraph for a discharge described in clause (ii) shall be a diagnosis-related group that does not result in higher payment based on the presence of a secondary diagnosis code described in clause (iv).

* (ii) A discharge described in this clause is a discharge which meets the following requirements:

  * (I) The discharge includes a condition identified by a diagnosis code selected under clause (iv) as a secondary diagnosis.

  * (II) But for clause (i), the discharge would have been classified to a diagnosis-related group that results in a higher payment based on the presence of a secondary diagnosis code selected under clause (iv).

  * (III) At the time of admission, no code selected under clause (iv) was present.


* (iii) As part of the information required to be reported by a hospital with respect to a discharge of an individual in order for payment to be made under this subsection, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007, the information shall include the secondary diagnosis of the individual at admission.

* (iv) By not later than October 1, 2007, the Secretary shall select diagnosis codes associated with at least two conditions, each of which codes meets all of the following requirements (as determined by the Secretary):

  * (I) Cases described by such code have a high cost or high volume, or both, under this subchapter.

  * (II) The code results in the assignment of a case to a diagnosis-related group that has a higher payment when the code is present as a secondary diagnosis.

  * (III) The code describes such conditions that could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines.


* The Secretary may from time to time revise (through addition or deletion of codes) the diagnosis codes selected under this clause so long as there are diagnosis codes associated with at least two conditions selected for discharges occurring during any fiscal year.

* (v) In selecting and revising diagnosis codes under clause (iv), the Secretary shall consult with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other appropriate entities.

* (vi) Any change resulting from the application of this subparagraph shall not be taken into account in adjusting the weighting factors under subparagraph (C)(i) or in applying budget neutrality under subparagraph (C)(iii).

* (5)(A)(i) For discharges occurring during fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 1997, the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for a subsection (d) hospital for any discharge in a diagnosis-related group, the length of stay of which exceeds the mean length of stay for discharges within that group by a fixed number of days, or exceeds such mean length of stay by some fixed number of standard deviations, whichever is the fewer number of days.

* (ii) For cases which are not included in clause (i), a subsection (d) hospital may request additional payments in any case where charges, adjusted to cost, exceed a fixed multiple of the applicable DRG prospective payment rate, or exceed such other fixed dollar amount, whichever is greater, or, for discharges in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1994, exceed the sum of the applicable DRG prospective payment rate plus any amounts payable under subparagraphs (B) and (F) plus a fixed dollar amount determined by the Secretary.

* (iii) The amount of such additional payment under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall (except as payments under clause (i) are required to be reduced to take into account the requirements of clause (v)) approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i) or (ii).

* (iv) The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for discharges in a fiscal year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on DRG prospective payment rates for discharges in that year.

* (v) The Secretary shall provide that—

  * (I) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1995 shall be 75 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994;

  * (II) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1996 shall be 50 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994; and

  * (III) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1997 shall be 25 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994.


* (vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "day outlier percentage" means, for a fiscal year, the percentage of the total additional payments made by the Secretary under this subparagraph for discharges in that fiscal year which are additional payments under clause (i).

* (B) The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount for subsection (d) hospitals with indirect costs of medical education, in an amount computed in the same manner as the adjustment for such costs under regulations (in effect as of January 1, 1983) under subsection (a)(2), except as follows:

  * (i) The amount of such additional payment shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and, for cases qualifying for additional payment under subparagraph (A)(i), the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A), by (II) the indirect teaching adjustment factor described in clause (ii).

  * (ii) For purposes of clause (i)(II), the indirect teaching adjustment factor is equal to c × (((1+r) to the nth power) −1), where "r" is the ratio of the hospital's full-time equivalent interns and residents to beds and "n" equals .405. Subject to clause (ix), for discharges occurring—

    * (I) on or after October 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1997, "c" is equal to 1.89;

    * (II) during fiscal year 1998, "c" is equal to 1.72;

    * (III) during fiscal year 1999, "c" is equal to 1.6;

    * (IV) during fiscal year 2000, "c" is equal to 1.47;

    * (V) during fiscal year 2001, "c" is equal to 1.54;

    * (VI) during fiscal year 2002, "c" is equal to 1.6;

    * (VII) on or after October 1, 2002, and before April 1, 2004, "c" is equal to 1.35;

    * (VIII) on or after April 1, 2004, and before October 1, 2004, "c" is equal to 1.47;

    * (IX) during fiscal year 2005, "c" is equal to 1.42;

    * (X) during fiscal year 2006, "c" is equal to 1.37;

    * (XI) during fiscal year 2007, "c" is equal to 1.32; and

    * (XII) on or after October 1, 2007, "c" is equal to 1.35.


  * (iii) In determining such adjustment the Secretary shall not distinguish between those interns and residents who are employees of a hospital and those interns and residents who furnish services to a hospital but are not employees of such hospital.

  * (iv)(I) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before July 1, 2010, all the time spent by an intern or resident in patient care activities under an approved medical residency training program at an entity in a nonhospital setting shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency if the hospital incurs all, or substantially all, of the costs for the training program in that setting.

  * (II) Effective for discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2010, all the time spent by an intern or resident in patient care activities in a nonprovider setting shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency if a hospital incurs the costs of the stipends and fringe benefits of the intern or resident during the time the intern or resident spends in that setting. If more than one hospital incurs these costs, either directly or through a third party, such hospitals shall count a proportional share of the time, as determined by written agreement between the hospitals, that a resident spends training in that setting.

  * (v) In determining the adjustment with respect to a hospital for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the total number of full-time equivalent interns and residents in the fields of allopathic and osteopathic medicine in either a hospital or nonhospital setting may not exceed the number (or, 130 percent of such number in the case of a hospital located in a rural area) of such full-time equivalent interns and residents in the hospital with respect to the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996. Rules similar to the rules of subsection (h)(4)(F)(ii) shall apply for purposes of this clause. The provisions of subsections (h)(4)(H)(vi), (h)(7), (h)(8), and (h)(9) shall apply with respect to the first sentence of this clause in the same manner as they apply with respect to subsection (h)(4)(F)(i).

  * (vi) For purposes of clause (ii)—

    * (I) "r" may not exceed the ratio of the number of interns and residents, subject to the limit under clause (v), with respect to the hospital for its most recent cost reporting period to the hospital's available beds (as defined by the Secretary) during that cost reporting period, and

    * (II) for the hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to the limits described in clauses (iv) and (v), the total number of full-time equivalent residents for payment purposes shall equal the average of the actual full-time equivalent resident count for the cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods.


* In the case of the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subclause (II) shall be applied by using the average for such period and the preceding cost reporting period.

  * (vii) If any cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, is not equal to twelve months, the Secretary shall make appropriate modifications to ensure that the average full-time equivalent residency count pursuant to subclause (II) of clause (vi) is based on the equivalent of full twelve-month cost reporting periods.

  * (viii) Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (2)(F)(iv) and (4)(H) of subsection (h) shall apply for purposes of clauses (v) and (vi).

  * (ix) For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2005, insofar as an additional payment amount under this subparagraph is attributable to resident positions redistributed to a hospital under subsection (h)(7)(B), in computing the indirect teaching adjustment factor under clause (ii) the adjustment shall be computed in a manner as if "c" were equal to 0.66 with respect to such resident positions.

  * (x)For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2011, insofar as an additional payment amount under this subparagraph is attributable to resident positions distributed to a hospital under subsection (h)(8)(B), the indirect teaching adjustment factor shall be computed in the same manner as provided under clause (ii) with respect to such resident positions.

  * (xi)(I) The provisions of subparagraph (K) of subsection (h)(4) shall apply under this subparagraph in the same manner as they apply under such subsection.

  * (II) In determining the hospital's number of full-time equivalent residents for purposes of this subparagraph, all the time spent by an intern or resident in an approved medical residency training program in non-patient care activities, such as didactic conferences and seminars, as such time and activities are defined by the Secretary, that occurs in the hospital shall be counted toward the determination of full-time equivalency if the hospital—

    * (aa) is recognized as a subsection (d) hospital;

    * (bb) is recognized as a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital;

    * (cc) is reimbursed under a reimbursement system authorized under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title; or

    * (dd) is a provider-based hospital outpatient department.


  * (III) In determining the hospital's number of full-time equivalent residents for purposes of this subparagraph, all the time spent by an intern or resident in an approved medical residency training program in research activities that are not associated with the treatment or diagnosis of a particular patient, as such time and activities are defined by the Secretary, shall not be counted toward the determination of full-time equivalency.

  * (xii) For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2023, insofar as an additional payment amount under this subparagraph is attributable to resident positions distributed to a hospital under subsection (h)(9), the indirect teaching adjustment factor shall be computed in the same manner as provided under clause (ii) with respect to such resident positions.


* (C)(i) The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions and adjustments to the payment amounts established under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the special needs of regional and national referral centers (including those hospitals of 275 or more beds located in rural areas). A hospital which is classified as a rural hospital may appeal to the Secretary to be classified as a rural referral center under this clause on the basis of criteria (established by the Secretary) which shall allow the hospital to demonstrate that it should be so reclassified by reason of certain of its operating characteristics being similar to those of a typical urban hospital located in the same census region and which shall not require a rural osteopathic hospital to have more than 3,000 discharges in a year in order to be classified as a rural referral center. Such characteristics may include wages, scope of services, service area, and the mix of medical specialties. The Secretary shall publish the criteria not later than August 17, 1984, for implementation by October 1, 1984. An appeal allowed under this clause must be submitted to the Secretary (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) during the quarter before the first quarter of the hospital's cost reporting period (or, in the case of a cost reporting period beginning during October 1984, during the first quarter of that period), and the Secretary must make a final determination with respect to such appeal within 60 days after the date the appeal was submitted. Any payment adjustments necessitated by a reclassification based upon the appeal shall be effective at the beginning of such cost reporting period.

* (ii) The Secretary shall provide, under clause (i), for the classification of a rural hospital as a regional referral center if the hospital has a case mix index equal to or greater than the median case mix index for hospitals (other than hospitals with approved teaching programs) located in an urban area in the same region (as defined in paragraph (2)(D)), has at least 5,000 discharges a year or, if less, the median number of discharges in urban hospitals in the region in which the hospital is located (or, in the case of a rural osteopathic hospital, meets the criterion established by the Secretary under clause (i) with respect to the annual number of discharges for such hospitals), and meets any other criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i).

* (D)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, with respect to a subsection (d) hospital which is a sole community hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be—

  * (I) an amount based on 100 percent of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period, as defined in subsection (b)(3)(C), or

  * (II) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii),


* whichever results in greater payment to the hospital.

* (ii) In the case of a sole community hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.

* (iii) For purposes of this subchapter, the term "sole community hospital" means any hospital—

  * (I) that the Secretary determines is located more than 35 road miles from another hospital,

  * (II) that, by reason of factors such as the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care (in accordance with standards promulgated by the Secretary), location, weather conditions, travel conditions, or absence of other like hospitals (as determined by the Secretary), is the sole source of inpatient hospital services reasonably available to individuals in a geographic area who are entitled to benefits under part A, or

  * (III) that is located in a rural area and designated by the Secretary as an essential access community hospital under section 1395i–4(i)(1) of this title as in effect on September 30, 1997.


* (iv) The Secretary shall promulgate a standard for determining whether a hospital meets the criteria for classification as a sole community hospital under clause (iii)(II) because of the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care.

* (v) If the Secretary determines that, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area and designated by the Secretary as an essential access community hospital under section 1395i–4(i)(1) of this title as in effect on September 30, 1997, the hospital has incurred increases in reasonable costs during a cost reporting period as a result of becoming a member of a rural health network (as defined in section 1395i–4(d) of this title) in the State in which it is located, and in incurring such increases, the hospital will increase its costs for subsequent cost reporting periods, the Secretary shall increase the hospital's target amount under subsection (b)(3)(C) to account for such incurred increases.

* (E)(i) The Secretary shall estimate the amount of reimbursement made for services described in section 1395y(a)(14) of this title with respect to which payment was made under part B in the base reporting periods referred to in paragraph (2)(A) and with respect to which payment is no longer being made.

* (ii) The Secretary shall provide for an adjustment to the payment for subsection (d) hospitals in each fiscal year so as appropriately to reflect the net amount described in clause (i).

* (F)(i) Subject to subsection (r), for discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986, the Secretary shall provide, in accordance with this subparagraph, for an additional payment amount for each subsection (d) hospital which—

  * (I) serves a significantly disproportionate number of low-income patients (as defined in clause (v)), or

  * (II) is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, and can demonstrate that its net inpatient care revenues (excluding any of such revenues attributable to this subchapter or State plans approved under subchapter XIX), during the cost reporting period in which the discharges occur, for indigent care from State and local government sources exceed 30 percent of its total of such net inpatient care revenues during the period.


* (ii) Subject to clause (ix), the amount of such payment for each discharge shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and, for cases qualifying for additional payment under subparagraph (A)(i), the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A) for that discharge, by (II) the disproportionate share adjustment percentage established under clause (iii) or (iv) for the cost reporting period in which the discharge occurs.

* (iii) The disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (i)(II) is equal to 35 percent.

* (iv) The disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital that is not described in clause (i)(II) and that—

  * (I) is located in an urban area and has 100 or more beds or is described in the second sentence of clause (v), is equal to the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (vii);

  * (II) is located in an urban area and has less than 100 beds, is equal to 5 percent or, subject to clause (xiv) and for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, is equal to the percent determined in accordance with clause (xiii);

  * (III) is located in a rural area and is not described in subclause (IV) or (V) or in the second sentence of clause (v), is equal to 4 percent or, subject to clause (xiv) and for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, is equal to the percent determined in accordance with clause (xii);

  * (IV) is located in a rural area, is classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), and is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), is equal to 10 percent or, if greater, the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (viii) or, subject to clause (xiv) and for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, the greater of the percentages determined under clause (x) or (xi);

  * (V) is located in a rural area, is classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), and is not classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), is equal to the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (viii) or, subject to clause (xiv) and for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, is equal to the percent determined in accordance with clause (xi); or

  * (VI) is located in a rural area, is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), and is not classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), is 10 percent or, subject to clause (xiv) and for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, is equal to the percent determined in accordance with clause (x).


* (v) In this subparagraph, a hospital "serves a significantly disproportionate number of low income patients" for a cost reporting period if the hospital has a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) for that period which equals, or exceeds—

  * (I) 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has 100 or more beds,

  * (II) 30 percent (or 15 percent, for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001), if the hospital is located in a rural area and has more than 100 beds, or is located in a rural area and is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D),

  * (III) 40 percent (or 15 percent, for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001), if the hospital is located in an urban area and has less than 100 beds, or

  * (IV) 45 percent (or 15 percent, for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001), if the hospital is located in a rural area and is not described in subclause (II).


* A hospital located in a rural area and with 500 or more beds also "serves a significantly disproportionate number of low income patients" for a cost reporting period if the hospital has a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) for that period which equals or exceeds a percentage specified by the Secretary.

* (vi) In this subparagraph, the term "disproportionate patient percentage" means, with respect to a cost reporting period of a hospital, the sum of—

  * (I) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of such hospital's patient days for such period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and were entitled to supplementary security income benefits (excluding any State supplementation) under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and the denominator of which is the number of such hospital's patient days for such fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and

  * (II) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of the hospital's patient days for such period which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX, but who were not entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's patient days for such period.


* In determining under subclause (II) the number of the hospital's patient days for such period which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX, the Secretary may, to the extent and for the period the Secretary determines appropriate, include patient days of patients not so eligible but who are regarded as such because they receive benefits under a demonstration project approved under subchapter XI.

* (vii) The formula used to determine the disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (iv)(I) is—

  * (I) in the case of such a hospital with a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) greater than 20.2—

    * (a) for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and on or before December 31, 1990, (P−20.2)(.65) + 5.62,

    * (b) for discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before September 30, 1993, (P−20.2)(.7) + 5.62,

    * (c) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, and on or before September 30, 1994, (P−20.2)(.8) + 5.88, and

    * (d) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, (P−20.2)(.825) + 5.88; or


  * (II) in the case of any other such hospital—

    * (a) for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and on or before December 31, 1990, (P−15)(.6) + 2.5,

    * (b) for discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before September 30, 1993, (P−15)(.6) + 2.5,

    * (c) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, (P−15)(.65) + 2.5,


* where "P" is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

* (viii) Subject to clause (xiv), the formula used to determine the disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (iv)(IV) or (iv)(V) is the percentage determined in accordance with the following formula: (P−30)(.6) + 4.0, where "P" is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

* (ix) In the case of discharges occurring—

  * (I) during fiscal year 1998, the additional payment amount otherwise determined under clause (ii) shall be reduced by 1 percent;

  * (II) during fiscal year 1999, such additional payment amount shall be reduced by 2 percent;

  * (III) during fiscal years 2000 and 2001, such additional payment amount shall be reduced by 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively;

  * (III) is equal to or exceeds 30, such adjustment percentage is equal to 10 percent,


* where "P" is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

* (xi) Subject to clause (xiv), for purposes of clause (iv)(V) (relating to rural referral centers), in the case of a hospital for a cost reporting period with a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) that—

  * (I) is less than 19.3, the disproportionate share adjustment percentage is determined in accordance with the following formula: (P−15)(.65) + 2.5;

  * (II) is equal to or exceeds 19.3, but is less than 30.0, such adjustment percentage is equal to 5.25 percent; or

  * (III) is equal to or exceeds 30, such adjustment percentage is determined in accordance with the following formula: (P−30)(.6) + 5.25,


* where "P" is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

* (xii) Subject to clause (xiv), for purposes of clause (iv)(III) (relating to small rural hospitals generally), in the case of a hospital for a cost reporting period with a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) that—

  * (I) is less than 19.3, the disproportionate share adjustment percentage is determined in accordance with the following formula: (P−15)(.65) + 2.5; or

  * (II) is equal to or exceeds 19.3, such adjustment percentage is equal to 5.25 percent,


* where "P" is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

* (xiv)(I) In the case of discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2004, subject to subclause (II), there shall be substituted for the disproportionate share adjustment percentage otherwise determined under clause (iv) (other than subclause (I)) or under clause (viii), (x), (xi), (xii), or (xiii), the disproportionate share adjustment percentage determined under clause (vii) (relating to large, urban hospitals).

* (II) Under subclause (I), the disproportionate share adjustment percentage shall not exceed 12 percent for a hospital that is not classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C) or, in the case of discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006, as a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital under subparagraph (G)(iv).

* (G)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1994, or discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2022, in the case of a subsection (d) hospital which is a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be equal to the sum of the amount determined under clause (ii) and the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).

* (ii) The amount determined under this clause is—

  * (I) for discharges occurring during the 36-month period beginning with the first day of the cost reporting period that begins on or after April 1, 1990, the amount by which the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(D)) exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii); and

  * (II) for discharges occurring during any subsequent cost reporting period (or portion thereof) and before October 1, 1994, or discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2022, 50 percent (or 75 percent in the case of discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006) of the amount by which the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period or for discharges in the fiscal year (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(D)) exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).


* (iii) In the case of a medicare dependent, small rural hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.

* (iv) The term "medicare-dependent, small rural hospital" means, with respect to any cost reporting period to which clause (i) applies, any hospital—

  * (I) that is located in—

    * (aa) a rural area; or

  * (IV) for which not less than 60 percent of its inpatient days or discharges during the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987, or two of the three most recently audited cost reporting periods for which the Secretary has a settled cost report, were attributable to inpatients entitled to benefits under part A.


* Subclause (I)(bb) shall apply for purposes of payment under clause (ii) only for discharges of a hospital occurring on or after the effective date of a determination of medicare-dependent small rural hospital status made by the Secretary with respect to the hospital after February 9, 2018. For purposes of applying subclause (II) of paragraph (8)(E)(ii) under subclause (I)(bb), such subclause (II) shall be applied by inserting "as of January 1, 2018," after "such State" each place it appears.

* (H) The Secretary may provide for such adjustments to the payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii.

* (I)(i) The Secretary shall provide by regulation for such other exceptions and adjustments to such payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate.

* (ii) In making adjustments under clause (i) for transfer cases (as defined by the Secretary) in a fiscal year, not taking in account the effect of subparagraph (J), the Secretary may make adjustments to each of the average standardized amounts determined under paragraph (3) to assure that the aggregate payments made under this subsection for such fiscal year are not greater or lesser than those that would have otherwise been made in such fiscal year.

* (J)(i) The Secretary shall treat the term "transfer case" (as defined in subparagraph (I)(ii)) as including the case of a qualified discharge (as defined in clause (ii)), which is classified within a diagnosis-related group described in clause (iii), and which occurs on or after October 1, 1998. In the case of a qualified discharge for which a substantial portion of the costs of care are incurred in the early days of the inpatient stay (as defined by the Secretary), in no case may the payment amount otherwise provided under this subsection exceed an amount equal to the sum of—

  * (I) 50 percent of the amount of payment under this subsection for transfer cases (as established under subparagraph (I)(i)), and

  * (II) 50 percent of the amount of payment which would have been made under this subsection with respect to the qualified discharge if no transfer were involved.


* (ii) For purposes of clause (i), subject to clause (iii), the term "qualified discharge" means a discharge classified with a diagnosis-related group (described in clause (iii)) of an individual from a subsection (d) hospital, if upon such discharge the individual—

  * (I) is admitted as an inpatient to a hospital or hospital unit that is not a subsection (d) hospital for the provision of inpatient hospital services;

  * (II) is admitted to a skilled nursing facility;

  * (III) is provided home health services from a home health agency, if such services relate to the condition or diagnosis for which such individual received inpatient hospital services from the subsection (d) hospital, and if such services are provided within an appropriate period (as determined by the Secretary);

  * (IV) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2018, is provided hospice care by a hospice program; or

  * (V) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2000, the individual receives post discharge services described in clause (iv)(I).


* (iii) Subject to clause (iv), a diagnosis-related group described in this clause is—

  * (I) 1 of 10 diagnosis-related groups selected by the Secretary based upon a high volume of discharges classified within such groups and a disproportionate use of post discharge services described in clause (ii); and

  * (II) a diagnosis-related group specified by the Secretary under clause (iv)(II).


* (iv) The Secretary shall include in the proposed rule published under subsection (e)(5)(A) for fiscal year 2001, a description of the effect of this subparagraph. The Secretary shall include in the proposed rule published for fiscal year 2019, a description of the effect of clause (ii)(IV). The Secretary may include in the proposed rule (and in the final rule published under paragraph (6)) for fiscal year 2001 or a subsequent fiscal year, a description of—

  * (I) post-discharge services not described in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and, in the case of proposed and final rules for fiscal year 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, (IV) of clause (ii), the receipt of which results in a qualified discharge; and

  * (II) diagnosis-related groups described in clause (iii)(I) in addition to the 10 selected under such clause.


* (K)(i) Effective for discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2001, the Secretary shall establish a mechanism to recognize the costs of new medical services and technologies under the payment system established under this subsection. Such mechanism shall be established after notice and opportunity for public comment (in the publications required by subsection (e)(5) for a fiscal year or otherwise). Such mechanism shall be modified to meet the requirements of clause (viii).

* (ii) The mechanism established pursuant to clause (i) shall—

  * (I) apply to a new medical service or technology if, based on the estimated costs incurred with respect to discharges involving such service or technology, the DRG prospective payment rate otherwise applicable to such discharges under this subsection is inadequate (applying a threshold specified by the Secretary that is the lesser of 75 percent of the standardized amount (increased to reflect the difference between cost and charges) or 75 percent of one standard deviation for the diagnosis-related group involved);

  * (II) provide for the collection of data with respect to the costs of a new medical service or technology described in subclause (I) for a period of not less than two years and not more than three years beginning on the date on which an inpatient hospital code is issued with respect to the service or technology;

  * (III) provide for additional payment to be made under this subsection with respect to discharges involving a new medical service or technology described in subclause (I) that occur during the period described in subclause (II) in an amount that adequately reflects the estimated average cost of such service or technology; and

  * (IV) provide that discharges involving such a service or technology that occur after the close of the period described in subclause (II) will be classified within a new or existing diagnosis-related group with a weighting factor under paragraph (4)(B) that is derived from cost data collected with respect to discharges occurring during such period.


* (iii) For purposes of clause (ii)(II), the term "inpatient hospital code" means any code that is used with respect to inpatient hospital services for which payment may be made under this subsection and includes an alphanumeric code issued under the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification ("ICD–9–CM") and its subsequent revisions.

* (iv) For purposes of clause (ii)(III), the term "additional payment" means, with respect to a discharge for a new medical service or technology described in clause (ii)(I), an amount that exceeds the prospective payment rate otherwise applicable under this subsection to discharges involving such service or technology that would be made but for this subparagraph.

* (v) The requirement under clause (ii)(III) for an additional payment may be satisfied by means of a new-technology group (described in subparagraph (L)), an add-on payment, a payment adjustment, or any other similar mechanism for increasing the amount otherwise payable with respect to a discharge under this subsection. The Secretary may not establish a separate fee schedule for such additional payment for such services and technologies, by utilizing a methodology established under subsection (a) or (h) of section 1395m of this title to determine the amount of such additional payment, or by other similar mechanisms or methodologies.

* (vi) For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (L), a medical service or technology will be considered a "new medical service or technology" if the service or technology meets criteria established by the Secretary after notice and an opportunity for public comment.

* (vii) Under the mechanism under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide for the addition of new diagnosis and procedure codes in April 1 of each year, but the addition of such codes shall not require the Secretary to adjust the payment (or diagnosis-related group classification) under this subsection until the fiscal year that begins after such date.

* (viii) The mechanism established pursuant to clause (i) shall be adjusted to provide, before publication of a proposed rule, for public input regarding whether a new service or technology represents an advance in medical technology that substantially improves the diagnosis or treatment of individuals entitled to benefits under part A as follows:

  * (I) The Secretary shall make public and periodically update a list of all the services and technologies for which an application for additional payment under this subparagraph is pending.

  * (II) The Secretary shall accept comments, recommendations, and data from the public regarding whether the service or technology represents a substantial improvement.

  * (III) The Secretary shall provide for a meeting at which organizations representing hospitals, physicians, such individuals, manufacturers, and any other interested party may present comments, recommendations, and data to the clinical staff of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services before publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding whether service or technology represents a substantial improvement.


* (ix) Before establishing any add-on payment under this subparagraph with respect to a new technology, the Secretary shall seek to identify one or more diagnosis-related groups associated with such technology, based on similar clinical or anatomical characteristics and the cost of the technology. Within such groups the Secretary shall assign an eligible new technology into a diagnosis-related group where the average costs of care most closely approximate the costs of care of using the new technology. No add-on payment under this subparagraph shall be made with respect to such new technology and this clause shall not affect the application of paragraph (4)(C)(iii).

* (L)(i) In establishing the mechanism under subparagraph (K), the Secretary may establish new-technology groups into which a new medical service or technology will be classified if, based on the estimated average costs incurred with respect to discharges involving such service or technology, the DRG prospective payment rate otherwise applicable to such discharges under this subsection is inadequate.

* (ii) Such groups—

  * (I) shall not be based on the costs associated with a specific new medical service or technology; but

  * (II) shall, in combination with the applicable standardized amounts and the weighting factors assigned to such groups under paragraph (4)(B), reflect such cost cohorts as the Secretary determines are appropriate for all new medical services and technologies that are likely to be provided as inpatient hospital services in a fiscal year.


* (iii) The methodology for classifying specific hospital discharges within a diagnosis-related group under paragraph (4)(A) or a new-technology group shall provide that a specific hospital discharge may not be classified within both a diagnosis-related group and a new-technology group.

* (M)(i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020, in the case of a subsection (d) hospital that furnishes an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant to an individual during such a period, payment to such hospital for hematopoietic stem cell acquisition shall be made on a reasonable cost basis. The items included in such hematopoietic stem cell acquisition shall be specified by the Secretary through rulemaking.

* (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant" means, with respect to an individual, the intravenous infusion of hematopoietic cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood, but not including embryonic stem cells, of a donor to an individual that are or may be used to restore hematopoietic function in such individual having an inherited or acquired deficiency or defect.

* (6) The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before the August 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1984), of a description of the methodology and data used in computing the adjusted DRG prospective payment rates under this subsection, including any adjustments required under subsection (e)(1)(B).

* (7) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395oo of this title or otherwise of—

  * (A) the determination of the requirement, or the proportional amount, of any adjustment effected pursuant to subsection (e)(1) or the determination of the applicable percentage increase under paragraph (12)(A)(ii),

  * (B) the establishment of diagnosis-related groups, of the methodology for the classification of discharges within such groups, and of the appropriate weighting factors thereof under paragraph (4), including the selection and revision of codes under paragraph (4)(D), and

  * (C) the determination of whether services provided prior to a patient's inpatient admission are related to the admission (as described in subsection (a)(4)).


* (8)(A) In the case of any hospital which is located in an area which is, at any time after April 20, 1983, reclassified from an urban to a rural area, payments to such hospital for the first two cost reporting periods for which such reclassification is effective shall be made as follows:

  * (i) For the first such cost reporting period, payment shall be equal to the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification, plus an amount equal to two-thirds of the amount (if any) by which—

    * (I) the amount which would have been payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of an urban classification, exceeds

    * (II) the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification.


  * (ii) For the second such cost reporting period, payment shall be equal to the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification, plus an amount equal to one-third of the amount (if any) by which—

    * (I) the amount which would have been payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of an urban classification, exceeds

    * (II) the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification.


* (B)(i) For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall treat a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas as being located in the urban metropolitan statistical area to which the greatest number of workers in the county commute, if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating Metropolitan Statistical Areas (and for designating New England County Metropolitan Areas) described in clause (ii), if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties (or, for New England, similar recognized areas) were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or counties of all contiguous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (or New England County Metropolitan Areas).

* (ii) The standards described in this clause for cost reporting periods beginning in a fiscal year—

  * (I) before fiscal year 2003, are the standards published in the Federal Register on January 3, 1980, or, at the election of the hospital with respect to fiscal years 2001 and 2002, standards so published on March 30, 1990; and

  * (II) after fiscal year 2002, are the standards published in the Federal Register by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget based on the most recent available decennial population data.


* Subparagraphs (C) and (D) shall not apply with respect to the application of subclause (I).

* (C)(i) If the application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10), by treating hospitals located in a rural county or counties as being located in an urban area, or by treating hospitals located in one urban area as being located in another urban area—

  * (I) reduces the wage index for that urban area (as applied under this subsection) by 1 percentage point or less, the Secretary, in calculating such wage index under this subsection, shall exclude those hospitals so treated, or

  * (II) reduces the wage index for that urban area by more than 1 percentage point (as applied under this subsection), the Secretary shall calculate and apply such wage index under this subsection separately to hospitals located in such urban area (excluding all the hospitals so treated) and to the hospitals so treated (as if such hospitals were located in such urban area).


* (ii) If the application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10), by treating hospitals located in a rural county or counties as not being located in the rural area in a State, reduces the wage index for that rural area (as applied under this subsection), the Secretary shall calculate and apply such wage index under this subsection as if the hospitals so treated had not been excluded from calculation of the wage index for that rural area.

* (iii) The application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10) may not result in the reduction of any county's wage index to a level below the wage index for rural areas in the State in which the county is located.

* (iv) The application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or of the Secretary under paragraph (10) may not result in a reduction in an urban area's wage index if—

  * (I) the urban area has a wage index below the wage index for rural areas in the State in which it is located; or

  * (II) the urban area is located in a State that is composed of a single urban area.


* (v) This subparagraph shall apply with respect to discharges occurring in a fiscal year only if the Secretary uses a method for making adjustments to the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels under paragraph (3)(E) for the fiscal year that is based on the use of Metropolitan Statistical Area classifications.

* (D) The Secretary shall make a proportional adjustment in the standardized amounts determined under paragraph (3) to assure that the provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10) do not result in aggregate payments under this section that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made.

* (E)(i) For purposes of this subsection, not later than 60 days after the receipt of an application (in a form and manner determined by the Secretary) from a subsection (d) hospital described in clause (ii), the Secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in the rural area (as defined in paragraph (2)(D)) of the State in which the hospital is located.

* (ii) For purposes of clause (i), a subsection (d) hospital described in this clause is a subsection (d) hospital that is located in an urban area (as defined in paragraph (2)(D)) and satisfies any of the following criteria:

  * (I) The hospital is located in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area (as determined under the most recent modification of the Goldsmith Modification, originally published in the Federal Register on February 27, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 6725)).

  * (II) The hospital is located in an area designated by any law or regulation of such State as a rural area (or is designated by such State as a rural hospital).

  * (III) The hospital would qualify as a rural, regional, or national referral center under paragraph (5)(C) or as a sole community hospital under paragraph (5)(D) if the hospital were located in a rural area.

  * (IV) The hospital meets such other criteria as the Secretary may specify.


* (9)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for inpatient hospital discharges is equal to the sum of—

  * (i) the applicable Puerto Rico percentage (specified in subparagraph (E)) of the Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate (determined under subparagraph (B) or (C)) for such discharges,

  * (ii) the applicable Federal percentage (specified in subparagraph (E)) of—

    * (I) for discharges beginning in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2003, the discharge-weighted average of—

      * (aa) the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate (determined under paragraph (3)(D)) for hospitals located in a large urban area,

      * (bb) such rate for hospitals located in other urban areas, and

      * (cc) such rate for hospitals located in a rural area,


  * for such discharges, adjusted in the manner provided in paragraph (3)(E) for different area wage levels; and

    * (II) for discharges in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2003, the national DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (3)(D)(iii) for hospitals located in any area for such discharges, adjusted in the manner provided in paragraph (3)(E) for different area wage levels.


* As used in this section, the term "subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital" means a hospital that is located in Puerto Rico and that would be a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in paragraph (1)(B)) if it were located in one of the 50 States.

* (B) The Secretary shall determine a Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in fiscal year 1988 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Such rate shall be determined for such hospitals located in urban or rural areas within Puerto Rico, as follows:

  * (i) The Secretary shall determine the target amount (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(A)) for the hospital for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987 and increase such amount by prorating the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B)) to update the amount to the midpoint in fiscal year 1988.

  * (ii) The Secretary shall standardize the amount determined under clause (i) for each hospital by—

    * (I) excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs,

    * (II) adjusting for variations among hospitals by area in the average hospital wage level,

    * (III) adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals, and

    * (IV) excluding an estimate of the additional payments to certain subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals to be made under subparagraph (D)(iii) (relating to disproportionate share payments).


  * (iii) The Secretary shall compute a discharge weighted average of the standardized amounts determined under clause (ii) for all hospitals located in an urban area and for all hospitals located in a rural area (as such terms are defined in paragraph (2)(D)).

  * (iv) The Secretary shall reduce the average standardized amount by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this paragraph which are additional payments described in subparagraph (D)(i) (relating to outlier payments).

  * (v) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, the Secretary shall establish a Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate equal to the product of—

    * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under clause (iii) and reduced under clause (iv)) for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, and

    * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.


  * (vi) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate computed under clause (v) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the Puerto Rican average hospital wage level.


* (C) The Secretary shall determine a Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge after fiscal year 1988 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within Puerto Rico as follows:

  * (i)(I) For discharges in a fiscal year after fiscal year 1988 and before fiscal year 2004, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under subparagraph (B)(iii) or under this clause, increased for fiscal year 1989 by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B), and adjusted for subsequent fiscal years in accordance with the final determination of the Secretary under subsection (e)(4), and adjusted to reflect the most recent case-mix data available.

  * (II) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2004), the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in any area of Puerto Rico that is equal to the average standardized amount computed under subclause (I) for fiscal year 2003 for hospitals in a large urban area (or, beginning with fiscal year 2005, for all hospitals in the previous fiscal year) increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B) for the fiscal year involved.

  * (ii) The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts (or for fiscal year 2004 and thereafter, the average standardized amount) by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this paragraph which are additional payments described in subparagraph (D)(i) (relating to outlier payments).

  * (iii) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, the Secretary shall establish a Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate equal to the product of—

    * (I) the average standardized amount (computed under clause (i) and reduced under clause (ii)), and

    * (II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.


  * (iv)(I) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate computed under clause (iii) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the Puerto Rico average hospital wage level. The second and third sentences of paragraph (3)(E)(i) shall apply to subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals under this clause in the same manner as they apply to subsection (d) hospitals under such paragraph and, for purposes of this clause, any reference in such paragraph to a subsection (d) hospital is deemed a reference to a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital.

  * (II) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, the Secretary shall substitute "62 percent" for the proportion described in the first sentence of clause (i), unless the application of this subclause would result in lower payments to a hospital than would otherwise be made.


* (D) The following provisions of paragraph (5) shall apply to subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals receiving payment under this paragraph in the same manner and to the extent as they apply to subsection (d) hospitals receiving payment under this subsection:

  * (i) Subparagraph (A) (relating to outlier payments).

  * (ii) Subparagraph (B) (relating to payments for indirect medical education costs), except that for this purpose the sum of the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the amount paid to the hospital under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be substituted for the sum referred to in paragraph (5)(B)(i)(I).

  * (iii) Subparagraph (F) (relating to disproportionate share payments), except that for this purpose the sum described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall be substituted for the sum referred to in paragraph (5)(F)(ii)(I).

  * (iv) Subparagraph (H) (relating to exceptions and adjustments).


* (E) For purposes of subparagraph (A), for discharges occurring—

  * (i) on or after October 1, 1987, and before October 1, 1997, the applicable Puerto Rico percentage is 75 percent and the applicable Federal percentage is 25 percent;

  * (ii) on or after October 1, 1997, and before April 1, 2004, the applicable Puerto Rico percentage is 50 percent and the applicable Federal percentage is 50 percent;

  * (iii) on or after April 1, 2004, and before October 1, 2004, the applicable Puerto Rico percentage is 37.5 percent and the applicable Federal percentage is 62.5 percent;

  * (iv) on or after October 1, 2004, and before January 1, 2016, the applicable Puerto Rico percentage is 25 percent and the applicable Federal percentage is 75 percent; and

  * (v) on or after January 1, 2016, the applicable Puerto Rico percentage is 0 percent and the applicable Federal percentage is 100 percent.


* (10)(A) There is hereby established the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the "Board").

* (B)(i) The Board shall be composed of 5 members appointed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5, governing appointments in the competitive service. Two of such members shall be representative of subsection (d) hospitals located in a rural area under paragraph (2)(D). At least 1 member shall be knowledgeable in the field of analyzing costs with respect to the provision of inpatient hospital services.

* (ii) The Secretary shall make initial appointments to the Board as provided in this paragraph within 180 days after December 19, 1989.

* (C)(i) The Board shall consider the application of any subsection (d) hospital requesting that the Secretary change the hospital's geographic classification for purposes of determining for a fiscal year—

  * (I) the hospital's average standardized amount under paragraph (2)(D), or

  * (II) the factor used to adjust the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels that applies to such hospital under paragraph (3)(E).


* (ii) A hospital requesting a change in geographic classification under clause (i) for a fiscal year shall submit its application to the Board not later than the first day of the 13-month period ending on September 30 of the preceding fiscal year.

* (iii)(I) The Board shall render a decision on an application submitted under clause (i) not later than 180 days after the deadline referred to in clause (ii).

* (II) Appeal of decisions of the Board shall be subject to the provisions of section 557b of title 5. The Secretary shall issue a decision on such an appeal not later than 90 days after the date on which the appeal is filed. The decision of the Secretary shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

* (D)(i) The Secretary shall publish guidelines to be utilized by the Board in rendering decisions on applications submitted under this paragraph, and shall include in such guidelines the following:

  * (I) Guidelines for comparing wages, taking into account (to the extent the Secretary determines appropriate) occupational mix, in the area in which the hospital is classified and the area in which the hospital is applying to be classified.

  * (II) Guidelines for determining whether the county in which the hospital is located should be treated as being a part of a particular Metropolitan Statistical Area.

  * (III) Guidelines for considering information provided by an applicant with respect to the effects of the hospital's geographic classification on access to inpatient hospital services by medicare beneficiaries.

  * (IV) Guidelines for considering the appropriateness of the criteria used to define New England County Metropolitan Areas.


* (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary uses a method for making adjustments to the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels under paragraph (3)(E) that is not based on the use of Metropolitan Statistical Area classifications, the Secretary may revise the guidelines published under clause (i) to the extent such guidelines are used to determine the appropriateness of the geographic area in which the hospital is determined to be located for purposes of making such adjustments.

* (iii) Under the guidelines published by the Secretary under clause (i), in the case of a hospital which has ever been classified by the Secretary as a rural referral center under paragraph (5)(C), the Board may not reject the application of the hospital under this paragraph on the basis of any comparison between the average hourly wage of the hospital and the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area in which it is located.

* (iv) The Secretary shall publish the guidelines described in clause (i) by July 1, 1990.

* (v) Any decision of the Board to reclassify a subsection (d) hospital for purposes of the adjustment factor described in subparagraph (C)(i)(II) for fiscal year 2001 or any fiscal year thereafter shall be effective for a period of 3 fiscal years, except that the Secretary shall establish procedures under which a subsection (d) hospital may elect to terminate such reclassification before the end of such period.

* (vi) Such guidelines shall provide that, in making decisions on applications for reclassification for the purposes described in clause (v) for fiscal year 2003 and any succeeding fiscal year, the Board shall base any comparison of the average hourly wage for the hospital with the average hourly wage for hospitals in an area on—

  * (I) an average of the average hourly wage amount for the hospital from the most recently published hospital wage survey data of the Secretary (as of the date on which the hospital applies for reclassification) and such amount from each of the two immediately preceding surveys; and

  * (II) an average of the average hourly wage amount for hospitals in such area from the most recently published hospital wage survey data of the Secretary (as of the date on which the hospital applies for reclassification) and such amount from each of the two immediately preceding surveys.


* (E)(i) The Board shall have full power and authority to make rules and establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter or regulations of the Secretary, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. In the course of any hearing the Board may administer oaths and affirmations. The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 405 of this title with respect to subpenas shall apply to the Board to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Secretary with respect to subchapter II.

* (ii) The Board is authorized to engage such technical assistance and to receive such information as may be required to carry out its functions, and the Secretary shall, in addition, make available to the Board such secretarial, clerical, and other assistance as the Board may require to carry out its functions.

* (F)(i) Each member of the Board who is not an officer or employee of the Federal Government shall be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5 for each day (including travel time) during which such member is engaged in the performance of the duties of the Board. Each member of the Board who is an officer or employee of the United States shall serve without compensation in addition to that received for service as an officer or employee of the United States.

* (ii) Members of the Board shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, at rates authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, while away from their homes or regular places of business in the performance of services for the Board.

* (11) ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS FOR MANAGED CARE ENROLLEES.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—For portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 1998, the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount for each applicable discharge of any subsection (d) hospital that has an approved medical residency training program.

  * (B) APPLICABLE DISCHARGE.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term "applicable discharge" means the discharge of any individual who is enrolled under a risk-sharing contract with an eligible organization under section 1395mm of this title and who is entitled to benefits under part A or any individual who is enrolled with a Medicare+Choice organization under part C.

  * (C) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT.—The amount of the payment under this paragraph with respect to any applicable discharge shall be equal to the applicable percentage (as defined in subsection (h)(3)(D)(ii)) of the estimated average per discharge amount that would otherwise have been paid under paragraph (5)(B) if the individuals had not been enrolled as described in subparagraph (B).

  * (D) SPECIAL RULE FOR HOSPITALS UNDER REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM.—The Secretary shall establish rules for the application of this paragraph to a hospital reimbursed under a reimbursement system authorized under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title in the same manner as it would apply to the hospital if it were not reimbursed under such section.


* (12) PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT FOR LOW-VOLUME HOSPITALS.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—In addition to any payments calculated under this section for a subsection (d) hospital, for discharges occurring during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2005), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount to each low-volume hospital (as defined in subparagraph (C)(i)) for discharges occurring during that fiscal year that is equal to the applicable percentage increase (determined under subparagraph (B) or (D) for the hospital involved) in the amount paid to such hospital under this section for such discharges (determined without regard to this paragraph).

  * (B) APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE INCREASE.—For discharges occurring in fiscal years 2005 through 2010 and for discharges occurring in fiscal year 2023 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall determine an applicable percentage increase for purposes of subparagraph (A) as follows:

    * (i) The Secretary shall determine the empirical relationship for subsection (d) hospitals between the standardized cost-per-case for such hospitals and the total number of discharges of such hospitals and the amount of the additional incremental costs (if any) that are associated with such number of discharges.

    * (ii) The applicable percentage increase shall be determined based upon such relationship in a manner that reflects, based upon the number of such discharges for a subsection (d) hospital, such additional incremental costs.

    * (iii) In no case shall the applicable percentage increase exceed 25 percent.


  * (C) DEFINITIONS.—

    * (i) LOW-VOLUME HOSPITAL.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term "low-volume hospital" means, for a fiscal year, a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in paragraph (1)(B)) that the Secretary determines is located more than 25 road miles (or, with respect to fiscal years 2011 through 2022, 15 road miles) from another subsection (d) hospital and has—

      * (I) with respect to each of fiscal years 2005 through 2010, less than 800 discharges during the fiscal year;

      * (II) with respect to each of fiscal years 2011 through 2018, less than 1,600 discharges of individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under part A during the fiscal year or portion of fiscal year;

      * (IV) with respect to fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, less than 800 discharges during the fiscal year.


    * (ii) DISCHARGE.—For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (D) and clause (i), the term "discharge" means an inpatient acute care discharge of an individual regardless (except as provided in clause (i)(II) and subparagraph (D)(i)) of whether the individual is entitled to benefits under part A.

    * (iii) TREATMENT OF INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE AND NON-INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FACILITIES.—For purposes of determining whether—

      * (I) a subsection (d) hospital of the Indian Health Service (whether operated by such Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are defined in section 1603 of title 25)), or

      * (II) a subsection (d) hospital other than a hospital of the Indian Health Service meets the mileage criterion under clause (i) with respect to fiscal year 2011 or a succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary shall apply the policy described in the regulation at part 412.101(e) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on March 23, 2018).


  * (D) TEMPORARY APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE INCREASE.—For discharges occurring in fiscal years 2011 through 2022, the Secretary shall determine an applicable percentage increase for purposes of subparagraph (A) using a continuous linear sliding scale ranging from 25 percent for low-volume hospitals—

    * (i) with respect to each of fiscal years 2011 through 2018, with 200 or fewer discharges of individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under part A in the fiscal year or the portion of fiscal year to 0 percent for low-volume hospitals with greater than 1,600 discharges of such individuals in the fiscal year or the portion of fiscal year or portion of fiscal year; and

    * (ii) with respect to each of fiscal years 2019 through 2022, with 500 or fewer discharges in the fiscal year to 0 percent for low-volume hospitals with greater than 3,800 discharges in the fiscal year.


* (13)(A) In order to recognize commuting patterns among geographic areas, the Secretary shall establish a process through application or otherwise for an increase of the wage index applied under paragraph (3)(E) for subsection (d) hospitals located in a qualifying county described in subparagraph (B) in the amount computed under subparagraph (D) based on out-migration of hospital employees who reside in that county to any higher wage index area.

* (B) The Secretary shall establish criteria for a qualifying county under this subparagraph based on the out-migration referred to in subparagraph (A) and differences in the area wage indices. Under such criteria the Secretary shall, utilizing such data as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, establish—

  * (i) a threshold percentage, established by the Secretary, of the weighted average of the area wage index or indices for the higher wage index areas involved;

  * (ii) a threshold (of not less than 10 percent) for minimum out-migration to a higher wage index area or areas; and

  * (iii) a requirement that the average hourly wage of the hospitals in the qualifying county equals or exceeds the average hourly wage of all the hospitals in the area in which the qualifying county is located.


* (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "higher wage index area" means, with respect to a county, an area with a wage index that exceeds that of the county.

* (D) The increase in the wage index under subparagraph (A) for a qualifying county shall be equal to the percentage of the hospital employees residing in the qualifying county who are employed in any higher wage index area multiplied by the sum of the products, for each higher wage index area of—

  * (i) the difference between—

    * (I) the wage index for such higher wage index area, and

    * (II) the wage index of the qualifying county; and


  * (ii) the number of hospital employees residing in the qualifying county who are employed in such higher wage index area divided by the total number of hospital employees residing in the qualifying county who are employed in any higher wage index area.


* (E) The process under this paragraph may be based upon the process used by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board under paragraph (10). As the Secretary determines to be appropriate to carry out such process, the Secretary may require hospitals (including subsection (d) hospitals and other hospitals) and critical access hospitals, as required under section 1395cc(a)(1)(T) of this title, to submit data regarding the location of residence, or the Secretary may use data from other sources.

* (F) A wage index increase under this paragraph shall be effective for a period of 3 fiscal years, except that the Secretary shall establish procedures under which a subsection (d) hospital may elect to waive the application of such wage index increase.

* (G) A hospital in a county that has a wage index increase under this paragraph for a period and that has not waived the application of such an increase under subparagraph (F) is not eligible for reclassification under paragraph (8) or (10) during that period.

* (H) Any increase in a wage index under this paragraph for a county shall not be taken into account for purposes of—

  * (i) computing the wage index for portions of the wage index area (not including the county) in which the county is located; or

  * (ii) applying any budget neutrality adjustment with respect to such index under paragraph (8)(D).


* (I) The thresholds described in subparagraph (B), data on hospital employees used under this paragraph, and any determination of the Secretary under the process described in subparagraph (E) shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

#### (e) Proportional adjustments in applicable percentage increases
* (1)(A) For cost reporting periods of hospitals beginning in fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall provide for such proportional adjustment in the applicable percentage increase (otherwise applicable to the periods under subsection (b)(3)(B)) as may be necessary to assure that—

  * (i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsection (d)(1)(A)(i)(I) for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of hospitals (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title),


* are not greater or less than—

  * (ii) the target percentage (as defined in subsection (d)(1)(C)) of the payment amounts which would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year under this section under the law as in effect before April 20, 1983 (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title);


* except that the adjustment made under this subparagraph shall apply only to subsection (d) hospitals and shall not apply for purposes of making computations under subsection (d)(2)(B)(ii) or subsection (d)(3)(A).

* (B) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall provide under subsections (d)(2)(F) and (d)(3)(C) for such equal proportional adjustment in each of the average standardized amounts otherwise computed for that fiscal year as may be necessary to assure that—

  * (i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsection (d)(1)(A)(i)(II) and (d)(5) for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of hospitals (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title),


* are not greater or less than—

  * (ii) the DRG percentage (as defined in subsection (d)(1)(C)) of the payment amounts which would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year under this section under the law as in effect before April 20, 1983 (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title).


* (C) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1988, the Secretary shall provide for such equal proportional adjustment in each of the average standardized amounts otherwise computed under subsection (d)(3) for that fiscal year as may be necessary to assure that—

  * (i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsections (d)(1)(A)(iii), (d)(5), and (d)(9) for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of subsection (d) hospitals and subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals,


* are not greater or less than—

  * (ii) the payment amounts that would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year but for the enactment of the amendments made by section 9304 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.


* (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 105–33, title IV, §4022(b)(1)(A)(i), Aug. 5, 1997, 111 Stat. 354.

* (3) Repealed. Pub. L. 109–432, div. B, title I, §106(c)(2), Dec. 20, 2006, 120 Stat. 2983.

* (4)(A) Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission, the Secretary shall recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1988) an appropriate change factor for inpatient hospital services for discharges in that fiscal year which will take into account amounts necessary for the efficient and effective delivery of medically appropriate and necessary care of high quality. The appropriate change factor may be different for all large urban subsection (d) hospitals, other urban subsection (d) hospitals, urban subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, rural subsection (d) hospitals, and rural subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, and all other hospitals and units not paid under subsection (d), and may vary among such other hospitals and units.

* (B) In addition to the recommendation made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission under paragraph (2)(B), recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992) other appropriate changes in each existing reimbursement policy under this subchapter under which payments to an institution are based upon prospectively determined rates.

* (5) The Secretary shall cause to have published in the Federal Register, not later than—

  * (A) the April 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986), the Secretary's proposed recommendations under paragraph (4) for that fiscal year for public comment, and

  * (B) the August 1 before such fiscal year after such consideration of public comment on the proposal as is feasible in the time available, the Secretary's final recommendations under such paragraph for that year.


* The Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year the report of the Commission's recommendations submitted under paragraph (3) for that fiscal year. To the extent that the Secretary's recommendations under paragraph (4) differ from the Commission's recommendations for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) an explanation of the Secretary's grounds for not following the Commission's recommendations.

#### (f) Reporting of costs of hospitals receiving payments on basis of prospective rates
* (1)(A) The Secretary shall maintain a system for the reporting of costs of hospitals receiving payments computed under subsection (d).

* (B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall place into effect a standardized electronic cost reporting format for hospitals under this subchapter.

* (ii) The Secretary may delay or waive the implementation of such format in particular instances where such implementation would result in financial hardship (in particular with respect to hospitals with a small percentage of inpatients entitled to benefits under this subchapter).

* (2) If the Secretary determines, based upon information supplied by a quality improvement organization under part B of subchapter XI, that a hospital, in order to circumvent the payment method established under subsection (b) or (d) of this section, has taken an action that results in the admission of individuals entitled to benefits under part A unnecessarily, unnecessary multiple admissions of the same such individuals, or other inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to such individuals, the Secretary may—

  * (A) deny payment (in whole or in part) under part A with respect to inpatient hospital services provided with respect to such an unnecessary admission (or subsequent admission of the same individual), or

  * (B) require the hospital to take other corrective action necessary to prevent or correct the inappropriate practice.


* (3) The provisions of subsections (c) through (g) of section 1320a–7 of this title shall apply to determinations made under paragraph (2) in the same manner as they apply to exclusions effected under section 1320a–7(b)(13) of this title.

#### (g) Prospective payment for capital-related costs; return on equity capital for hospitals
* (1)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title, instead of any amounts that are otherwise payable under this subchapter with respect to the reasonable costs of subsection (d) hospitals and subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals for capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services, the Secretary shall, for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, provide for payments for such costs in accordance with a prospective payment system established by the Secretary. Aggregate payments made under subsection (d) and this subsection during fiscal years 1992 through 1995 shall be reduced in a manner that results in a reduction (as estimated by the Secretary) in the amount of such payments equal to a 10 percent reduction in the amount of payments attributable to capital-related costs that would otherwise have been made during such fiscal year had the amount of such payments been based on reasonable costs (as defined in section 1395x(v) of this title). For discharges occurring after September 30, 1993, the Secretary shall reduce by 7.4 percent the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in 42 CFR 412.308(c), as in effect on August 10, 1993) and shall (for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993) redetermine which payment methodology is applied to the hospital under such system to take into account such reduction. In addition to the reduction described in the preceding sentence, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the Secretary shall apply the budget neutrality adjustment factor used to determine the Federal capital payment rate in effect on September 30, 1995 (as described in section 412.352 of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations), to (i) the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in section 412.308(c) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997), and (ii) the unadjusted hospital-specific rate (as described in section 412.328(e)(1) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997), and, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2002, reduce the rates described in clauses (i) and (ii) by 2.1 percent.

* (B) Such system—

  * (i) shall provide for (I) a payment on a per discharge basis, and (II) an appropriate weighting of such payment amount as relates to the classification of the discharge;

  * (ii) may provide for an adjustment to take into account variations in the relative costs of capital and construction for the different types of facilities or areas in which they are located;

  * (iii) may provide for such exceptions (including appropriate exceptions to reflect capital obligations) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, and

  * (iv) may provide for suitable adjustment to reflect hospital occupancy rate.


* (C) In this paragraph, the term "capital-related costs" has the meaning given such term by the Secretary under subsection (a)(4) as of September 30, 1987, and does not include a return on equity capital.

* (2)(A) The Secretary shall provide that the amount which is allowable, with respect to reasonable costs of inpatient hospital services for which payment may be made under this subchapter, for a return on equity capital for hospitals shall, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 20, 1983, be equal to amounts otherwise allowable under regulations in effect on March 1, 1983, except that the rate of return to be recognized shall be equal to the applicable percentage (described in subparagraph (B)) of the average of the rates of interest, for each of the months any part of which is included in the reporting period, on obligations issued for purchase by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.

* (B) In this paragraph, the "applicable percentage" is—

  * (i) 75 percent, for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1987,

  * (ii) 50 percent, for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1988,

  * (iii) 25 percent, for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1989, and

  * (iv) 0 percent, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989.


* (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this subchapter with respect to all the capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital and a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital, the Secretary shall reduce the amounts of such payments otherwise established under this subchapter by—

  * (i) 3.5 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal year 1987,

  * (ii) 7 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) occurring during fiscal year 1988 on or after October 1, 1987, and before January 1, 1988,

  * (iii) 12 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) in fiscal year 1988, occurring on or after January 1, 1988,

  * (iv) 15 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) occurring during fiscal year 1989, and

  * (v) 15 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) occurring during the period beginning January 1, 1990, and ending September 30, 1991.


* (B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to payments with respect to the capital-related costs of any hospital that is a sole community hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(D)(iii)) or a critical access hospital (as defined in section 1395x(mm)(1) of this title).

* (4) In determining the amount of the payments that are attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal years 1998 through 2002 and that may be made under this subchapter with respect to capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services of a hospital which is described in clause (i), (ii), or (iv) of subsection (d)(1)(B) or a unit described in the matter after clause (v) of such subsection, the Secretary shall reduce the amounts of such payments otherwise determined under this subchapter by 15 percent.

#### (h) Payments for direct graduate medical education costs
* #### (1) Substitution of special payment rules
  * Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title, instead of any amounts that are otherwise payable under this subchapter with respect to the reasonable costs of hospitals for direct graduate medical education costs, the Secretary shall provide for payments for such costs in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection. In providing for such payments, the Secretary shall provide for an allocation of such payments between part A and part B (and the trust funds established under the respective parts) as reasonably reflects the proportion of direct graduate medical education costs of hospitals associated with the provision of services under each respective part.

* #### (2) Determination of hospital-specific approved FTE resident amounts
  * The Secretary shall determine, for each hospital with an approved medical residency training program, an approved FTE resident amount for each cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1985, as follows:

  * #### (A) Determining allowable average cost per FTE resident in a hospital's base period
    * The Secretary shall determine, for the hospital's cost reporting period that began during fiscal year 1984, the average amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter for direct graduate medical education costs of the hospital for each full-time-equivalent resident.

  * #### (B) Updating to the first cost reporting period
    * #### (i) In general
      * The Secretary shall update each average amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index during the 12-month cost reporting period described in such subparagraph.

    * #### (ii) Exception
      * The Secretary shall not perform an update under clause (i) in the case of a hospital if the hospital's reporting period, described in subparagraph (A), began on or after July 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1984.

  * #### (C) Amount for first cost reporting period
    * For the first cost reporting period of the hospital beginning on or after July 1, 1985, the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital is equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B) increased by 1 percent.

  * #### (D) Amount for subsequent cost reporting periods
    * #### (i) In general
      * Except as provided in a subsequent clause, for each subsequent cost reporting period, the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital is equal to the approved FTE resident amount determined under this paragraph for the previous cost reporting period updated, through the midpoint of the period, by projecting the estimated percentage change in the consumer price index during the 12-month period ending at that midpoint, with appropriate adjustments to reflect previous under- or over-estimations under this subparagraph in the projected percentage change in the consumer price index.

    * #### (ii) Freeze in update for fiscal years 1994 and 1995
      * For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital shall not be updated under clause (i) for a resident who is not a primary care resident (as defined in paragraph (5)(H)) or a resident enrolled in an approved medical residency training program in obstetrics and gynecology.

    * #### (iii) Floor for locality adjusted national average per resident amount
      * The approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 shall not be less than 70 percent, and for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2002 shall not be less than 85 percent, of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for the hospital and period.

    * #### (iv) Adjustment in rate of increase for hospitals with FTE approved amount above 140 percent of locality adjusted national average per resident amount
      * #### (I) Freeze for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and 2004 through 2013
        * For a cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2002 or during the period beginning with fiscal year 2004 and ending with fiscal year 2013, if the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the preceding cost reporting period exceeds 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for that hospital and period, subject to subclause (III), the approved FTE resident amount for the period involved shall be the same as the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital for such preceding cost reporting period.

      * #### (II) 2 percent decrease in update for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005
        * For the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2003, if the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the preceding cost reporting period exceeds 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for that hospital and preceding period, the approved FTE resident amount for the period involved shall be updated in the manner described in subparagraph (D)(i) except that, subject to subclause (III), the consumer price index applied for a 12-month period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2 percentage points.

      * #### (III) No adjustment below 140 percent
        * In no case shall subclause (I) or (II) reduce an approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for a cost reporting period below 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for such hospital and period.

  * #### (E) Determination of locality adjusted national average per resident amount
    * The Secretary shall determine a locality adjusted national average per resident amount with respect to a cost reporting period of a hospital beginning during a fiscal year as follows:

    * #### (i) Determining hospital single per resident amount
      * The Secretary shall compute for each hospital operating an approved graduate medical education program a single per resident amount equal to the average (weighted by number of full-time equivalent residents, as determined under paragraph (4)) of the primary care per resident amount and the non-primary care per resident amount computed under paragraph (2) for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1997.

    * #### (ii) Standardizing per resident amounts
      * The Secretary shall compute a standardized per resident amount for each such hospital by dividing the single per resident amount computed under clause (i) by an average of the 3 geographic index values (weighted by the national average weight for each of the work, practice expense, and malpractice components) as applied under section 1395w–4(e) of this title for 1999 for the fee schedule area in which the hospital is located.

    * #### (iii) Computing of weighted average
      * The Secretary shall compute the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under clause (ii) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital (as determined under paragraph (4)).

    * #### (iv) Computing national average per resident amount
      * The Secretary shall compute the national average per resident amount, for a hospital's cost reporting period that begins during fiscal year 2001, equal to the weighted average computed under clause (iii) increased by the estimated percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the period beginning with the month that represents the midpoint of the cost reporting periods described in clause (i) and ending with the midpoint of the hospital's cost reporting period that begins during fiscal year 2001.

    * #### (v) Adjusting for locality
      * The Secretary shall compute the product of—

        * (I) the national average per resident amount computed under clause (iv) for the hospital, and

        * (II) the geographic index value average (described and applied under clause (ii)) for the fee schedule area in which the hospital is located.

    * #### (vi) Computing locality adjusted amount
      * The locality adjusted national per resident amount for a hospital for—

        * (I) the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 is the product computed under clause (v); or

        * (II) each subsequent cost reporting period is equal to the locality adjusted national per resident amount for the hospital for the previous cost reporting period (as determined under this clause) updated, through the midpoint of the period, by projecting the estimated percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the 12-month period ending at that midpoint.

  * #### (F) Treatment of certain hospitals
    * (i) In the case of a hospital that did not have an approved medical residency training program or was not participating in the program under this subchapter for a cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1984, the Secretary shall, for the first such period for which it has such a residency training program and is participating under this subchapter, provide for such approved FTE resident amount as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, based on approved FTE resident amounts for comparable programs.

    * (ii) In applying this subparagraph in the case of a hospital that trains residents and has not entered into a GME affiliation agreement (as defined by the Secretary for purposes of paragraph (4)(H)(ii)), on or after December 27, 2020, the Secretary shall not establish an FTE resident amount until such time as the Secretary determines that the hospital has trained at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident in an approved medical residency training program in a cost reporting period.

    * (iii) In applying this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2020, in the case of a hospital that, as of such date, has an approved FTE resident amount based on the training in an approved medical residency program or programs of—

      * (I) less than 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident in any cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1997, as determined by the Secretary; or

      * (II) no more than 3.0 full-time-equivalent residents in any cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and before December 27, 2020, as determined by the Secretary,


  * in lieu of such FTE resident amount the Secretary shall, in accordance with the methodology described in section 413.77(e) of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation), establish a new FTE resident amount if the hospital trains at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident (in the case of a hospital described in subclause (I)) or more than 3.0 full-time-equivalent residents (in the case of a hospital described in subclause (II)) in a cost reporting period beginning on or after such date and before the date that is 5 years after such date.

    * (iv) For purposes of carrying out this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2020, a hospital shall report full-time-equivalent residents on its cost report for a cost reporting period if the hospital trains at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent residents in an approved medical residency training program or programs in such period.

    * (v) As appropriate, the Secretary may consider information from any cost reporting period necessary to establish a new FTE resident amount as described in clause (iii).

* #### (3) Hospital payment amount per resident
  * #### (A) In general
    * The payment amount, for a hospital cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1985, is equal to the product of—

      * (i) the aggregate approved amount (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for that period, and

      * (ii) the hospital's medicare patient load (as defined in subparagraph (C)) for that period.

  * #### (B) Aggregate approved amount
    * As used in subparagraph (A), the term "aggregate approved amount" means, for a hospital cost reporting period, the product of—

      * (i) the hospital's approved FTE resident amount (determined under paragraph (2)) for that period, and

      * (ii) the weighted average number of full-time-equivalent residents (as determined under paragraph (4)) in the hospital's approved medical residency training programs in that period.


  * The Secretary shall reduce the aggregate approved amount to the extent payment is made under subsection (k) for residents included in the hospital's count of full-time equivalent residents.

  * #### (C) Medicare patient load
    * As used in subparagraph (A), the term "medicare patient load" means, with respect to a hospital's cost reporting period, the fraction of the total number of inpatient-bed-days (as established by the Secretary) during the period which are attributable to patients with respect to whom payment may be made under part A.

  * #### (D) Payment for managed care enrollees
    * #### (i) In general
      * For portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 1998, the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount under this subsection for services furnished to individuals who are enrolled under a risk-sharing contract with an eligible organization under section 1395mm of this title and who are entitled to part A or with a Medicare+Choice organization under part C. The amount of such a payment shall equal, subject to clause (iii), the applicable percentage of the product of—

        * (I) the aggregate approved amount (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for that period; and

        * (II) the fraction of the total number of inpatient-bed days (as established by the Secretary) during the period which are attributable to such enrolled individuals.

    * #### (ii) Applicable percentage
      * For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage is—

        * (I) 20 percent in 1998,

        * (V) 100 percent in 2002 and subsequent years.

    * #### (iii) Proportional reduction for nursing and allied health education
      * The Secretary shall estimate a proportional adjustment in payments to all hospitals determined under clauses (i) and (ii) for portions of cost reporting periods beginning in a year (beginning with 2000) such that the proportional adjustment reduces payments in an amount for such year equal to the total additional payment amounts for nursing and allied health education determined under subsection (l) for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in that year.

    * #### (iv) Special rule for hospitals under reimbursement system
      * The Secretary shall establish rules for the application of this subparagraph to a hospital reimbursed under a reimbursement system authorized under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title in the same manner as it would apply to the hospital if it were not reimbursed under such section.

* #### (4) Determination of full-time-equivalent residents
  * #### (A) Rules
    * The Secretary shall establish rules consistent with this paragraph for the computation of the number of full-time-equivalent residents in an approved medical residency training program.

  * #### (B) Adjustment for part-year or part-time residents
    * Such rules shall take into account individuals who serve as residents for only a portion of a period with a hospital or simultaneously with more than one hospital.

  * #### (C) Weighting factors for certain residents
    * Subject to subparagraph (D), such rules shall provide, in calculating the number of full-time-equivalent residents in an approved residency program—

      * (i) before July 1, 1986, for each resident the weighting factor is 1.00,

      * (ii) on or after July 1, 1986, for a resident who is in the resident's initial residency period (as defined in paragraph (5)(F)), the weighting factor is 1.00,

      * (iii) on or after July 1, 1986, and before July 1, 1987, for a resident who is not in the resident's initial residency period (as defined in paragraph (5)(F)), the weighting factor is .75, and

      * (iv) on or after July 1, 1987, for a resident who is not in the resident's initial residency period (as defined in paragraph (5)(F)), the weighting factor is .50.

  * #### (D) Foreign medical graduates required to pass FMGEMS examination
    * #### (i) In general
      * Except as provided in clause (ii), such rules shall provide that, in the case of an individual who is a foreign medical graduate (as defined in paragraph (5)(D)), the individual shall not be counted as a resident on or after July 1, 1986, unless—

        * (I) the individual has passed the FMGEMS examination (as defined in paragraph (5)(E)), or

        * (II) the individual has previously received certification from, or has previously passed the examination of, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.

    * #### (ii) Transition for current FMGS
      * On or after July 1, 1986, but before July 1, 1987, in the case of a foreign medical graduate who—

        * (I) has served as a resident before July 1, 1986, and is serving as a resident after that date, but

        * (II) has not passed the FMGEMS examination or a previous examination of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates before July 1, 1986,


  * &nbsp;the individual shall be counted as a resident at a rate equal to one-half of the rate at which the individual would otherwise be counted.

  * #### (E) Counting time spent in outpatient settings
    * Subject to subparagraphs (J) and (K), such rules shall provide that only time spent in activities relating to patient care shall be counted and that—

      * (i) effective for cost reporting periods beginning before July 1, 2010, all the time; so spent by a resident under an approved medical residency training program shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency, without regard to the setting in which the activities are performed, if the hospital incurs all, or substantially all, of the costs for the training program in that setting; and

      * (ii) effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010, all the time so spent by a resident shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency, without regard to the setting in which the activities are performed, if a hospital incurs the costs of the stipends and fringe benefits of the resident during the time the resident spends in that setting. If more than one hospital incurs these costs, either directly or through a third party, such hospitals shall count a proportional share of the time, as determined by written agreement between the hospitals, that a resident spends training in that setting.


  * Any hospital claiming under this subparagraph for time spent in a nonprovider setting shall maintain and make available to the Secretary records regarding the amount of such time and such amount in comparison with amounts of such time in such base year as the Secretary shall specify.

  * #### (F) Limitation on number of residents in allopathic and osteopathic medicine
    * #### (i) In general
      * Such rules shall provide that for purposes of a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to paragraphs (7), (8), and (9), the total number of full-time equivalent residents before application of weighting factors (as determined under this paragraph) with respect to a hospital's approved medical residency training program in the fields of allopathic medicine and osteopathic medicine may not exceed the number (or, 130 percent of such number in the case of a hospital located in a rural area) of such full-time equivalent residents for the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.

    * #### (ii) Counting primary care residents on certain approved leaves of absence in base year FTE count
      * #### (I) In general
        * In determining the number of such full-time equivalent residents for a hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996, for purposes of clause (i), the Secretary shall count an individual to the extent that the individual would have been counted as a primary care resident for such period but for the fact that the individual, as determined by the Secretary, was on maternity or disability leave or a similar approved leave of absence.

      * #### (II) Limitation to 3 FTE residents for any hospital
        * The total number of individuals counted under subclause (I) for a hospital may not exceed 3 full-time equivalent residents.

    * For purposes of subparagraph (A), for a cost reporting period beginning—

      * (i) on or after October 1, 2000, and before October 1, 2001, the "TEFRA percentage" is 662/3 percent and the "prospective payment percentage" is 331/3 percent; and

      * (ii) on or after October 1, 2001, and before October 1, 2002, the "TEFRA percentage" is 331/3 percent and the "prospective payment percentage" is 662/3 percent.

  * #### (D) Payment unit
    * For purposes of this subsection, the term "payment unit" means a discharge.

  * #### (E) Construction relating to transfer authority
    * Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from providing for an adjustment to payments to take into account the early transfer of a patient from a rehabilitation facility to another site of care.

  * #### (F) Election to apply full prospective payment system
    * A rehabilitation facility may elect, not later than 30 days before its first cost reporting period for which the payment methodology under this subsection applies to the facility, to have payment made to the facility under this subsection under the provisions of subparagraph (B) (rather than subparagraph (A)) for each cost reporting period to which such payment methodology applies.

* #### (2) Patient case mix groups
  * #### (A) Establishment
    * The Secretary shall establish—

      * (i) classes of patient discharges of rehabilitation facilities by functional-related groups (each in this subsection referred to as a "case mix group"), based on impairment, age, comorbidities, and functional capability of the patient and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of functional independence measure-function related groups; and

      * (ii) a method of classifying specific patients in rehabilitation facilities within these groups.

  * #### (B) Weighting factors
    * For each case mix group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting which reflects the relative facility resources used with respect to patients classified within that group compared to patients classified within other groups.

  * #### (C) Adjustments for case mix
    * #### (i) In general
      * The Secretary shall from time to time adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under this paragraph as appropriate to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, case mix, number of payment units for which payment is made under this subchapter, and other factors which may affect the relative use of resources. Such adjustments shall be made in a manner so that changes in aggregate payments under the classification system are a result of real changes and are not a result of changes in coding that are unrelated to real changes in case mix.

    * #### (ii) Adjustment
      * Insofar as the Secretary determines that such adjustments for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under the classification system during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary shall adjust the per payment unit payment rate for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

  * #### (D) Data collection
    * The Secretary is authorized to require rehabilitation facilities that provide inpatient hospital services to submit such data as the Secretary deems necessary to establish and administer the prospective payment system under this subsection.

* #### (3) Payment rate
  * #### (A) In general
    * The Secretary shall determine a prospective payment rate for each payment unit for which such rehabilitation facility is entitled to receive payment under this subchapter. Subject to subparagraph (B), such rate for payment units occurring during a fiscal year shall be based on the average payment per payment unit under this subchapter for inpatient operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities using the most recent data available (as estimated by the Secretary as of the date of establishment of the system) adjusted—

      * (i) by updating such per-payment-unit amount to the fiscal year involved by the weighted average of the applicable percentage increases provided under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) (for cost reporting periods beginning during the fiscal year) covering the period from the midpoint of the period for such data through the midpoint of fiscal year 2000 and by an increase factor (described in subparagraph (C)) specified by the Secretary for subsequent fiscal years up to the fiscal year involved;

      * (ii) by reducing such rates by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (4) (relating to outlier and related payments);

      * (iii) for variations among rehabilitation facilities by area under paragraph (6);

      * (iv) by the weighting factors established under paragraph (2)(B); and

      * (v) by such other factors as the Secretary determines are necessary to properly reflect variations in necessary costs of treatment among rehabilitation facilities.

  * #### (B) Budget neutral rates
    * The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts under this subsection for payment units during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 at levels such that, in the Secretary's estimation, the amount of total payments under this subsection for such fiscal years (including any payment adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (6) but not taking into account any payment adjustment resulting from an election permitted under paragraph (1)(F)) shall be equal to 98 percent for fiscal year 2001 and 100 percent for fiscal year 2002 of the amount of payments that would have been made under this subchapter during the fiscal years for operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities had this subsection not been enacted. In establishing such payment amounts, the Secretary shall consider the effects of the prospective payment system established under this subsection on the total number of payment units from rehabilitation facilities and other factors described in subparagraph (A).

  * #### (C) Increase factor
    * #### (i) In general
      * For purposes of this subsection for payment units in each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), the Secretary shall establish an increase factor subject to clauses (ii) and (iii). Such factor shall be based on an appropriate percentage increase in a market basket of goods and services comprising services for which payment is made under this subsection, which may be the market basket percentage increase described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii). The increase factor to be applied under this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 shall be 0 percent.

    * #### (ii) Productivity and other adjustment
      * Subject to clause (iii), after establishing the increase factor described in clause (i) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor—

        * (I) for fiscal year 2012 and each subsequent fiscal year, by the productivity adjustment described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(xi)(II); and

        * (II) for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2019, by the other adjustment described in subparagraph (D).


  * &nbsp;The application of this clause may result in the increase factor under this subparagraph being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this subsection for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

    * #### (iii) Special rule for fiscal year 2018
      * The increase factor to be applied under this subparagraph for fiscal year 2018, after the application of clause (ii), shall be 1 percent.

  * #### (D) Other adjustment
    * For purposes of subparagraph (C)(ii)(II), the other adjustment described in this subparagraph is—

      * (i) for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;

      * (ii) for each of fiscal years 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;

      * (iii) for fiscal year 2014, 0.3 percentage point;

      * (iv) for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and

      * (v) for each of fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point.

* #### (4) Outlier and special payments
  * #### (A) Outliers
    * #### (i) In general
      * The Secretary may provide for an additional payment to a rehabilitation facility for patients in a case mix group, based upon the patient being classified as an outlier based on an unusual length of stay, costs, or other factors specified by the Secretary.

    * #### (ii) Payment based on marginal cost of care
      * The amount of such additional payment under clause (i) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i).

    * #### (iii) Total payments
      * The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for payment units in a fiscal year may not exceed 5 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on prospective payment rates for payment units in that year.

  * #### (B) Adjustment
    * The Secretary may provide for such adjustments to the payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the unique circumstances of rehabilitation facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.

* #### (5) Publication
  * The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before August 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), of the classification and weighting factors for case mix groups under paragraph (2) for such fiscal year and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates under this subsection for that fiscal year.

* #### (6) Area wage adjustment
  * The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of rehabilitation facilities' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the prospective payment rates computed under paragraph (3) for area differences in wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the rehabilitation facility compared to the national average wage level for such facilities. Not later than October 1, 2001 (and at least every 36 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of information available to the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing rehabilitation services. Any adjustments or updates made under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregated payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.

* #### (7) Quality reporting
  * #### (A) Reduction in update for failure to report
    * #### (i) In general
      * For purposes of fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, in the case of a rehabilitation facility that does not submit data to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraphs (C) and (F) with respect to such a fiscal year, after determining the increase factor described in paragraph (3)(C), and after application of subparagraphs (C)(iii) and (D) of paragraph (3), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor for payments for discharges occurring during such fiscal year by 2 percentage points.

    * #### (ii) Special rule
      * The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor described in paragraph (3)(C) being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this subsection for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

  * #### (B) Noncumulative application
    * Any reduction under subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to the fiscal year involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing the payment amount under this subsection for a subsequent fiscal year.

  * #### (C) Submission of quality data
    * Subject to subparagraph (G), for fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, each rehabilitation facility shall submit to the Secretary data on quality measures specified under subparagraph (D).

  * #### (A) In general
    * The Secretary shall make information available to the public regarding readmission rates of each subsection (d) hospital under the program.

        * (I) who are uninsured in 2013, the last year before coverage expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as calculated by the Secretary based on the most recent estimates available from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office before a vote in either House on the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 that, if determined in the affirmative, would clear such Act for enrollment); and

        * (II) who are uninsured in the most recent period for which data is available (as so calculated),


  * &nbsp;minus 0.1 percentage points for fiscal year 2014 and minus 0.2 percentage points for each of fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017.

    * #### (ii) 2018 and subsequent years
      * For fiscal year 2018 and each subsequent fiscal year, a factor equal to 1 minus the percent change in the percent of individuals who are uninsured, as determined by comparing the percent of individuals—

        * (I) who are uninsured in 2013 (as estimated by the Secretary, based on data from the Census Bureau or other sources the Secretary determines appropriate, and certified by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services); and

        * (II) who are uninsured in the most recent period for which data is available (as so estimated and certified),


  * &nbsp;minus 0.2 percentage points for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

  * #### (C) Factor three
    * A factor equal to the percent, for each subsection (d) hospital, that represents the quotient of—

      * (i) the amount of uncompensated care for such hospital for a period selected by the Secretary (as estimated by the Secretary, based on appropriate data (including, in the case where the Secretary determines that alternative data is available which is a better proxy for the costs of subsection (d) hospitals for treating the uninsured, the use of such alternative data)); and

      * (ii) the aggregate amount of uncompensated care for all subsection (d) hospitals that receive a payment under this subsection for such period (as so estimated, based on such data).

* #### (3) Limitations on review
  * There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, section 1395oo of this title, or otherwise of the following:

    * (A) Any estimate of the Secretary for purposes of determining the factors described in paragraph (2).

    * (B) Any period selected by the Secretary for such purposes.

    * Any reduction under subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to the rate year involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing the payment amount under the system described in paragraph (1) for a subsequent rate year.

  * #### (C) Submission of quality data
    * For rate year 2014 and each subsequent rate year, each psychiatric hospital and psychiatric unit shall submit to the Secretary data on quality measures specified under subparagraph (D).
