    * (A) such determination or legislative change in benefits shall not apply to contracts under this part until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period, and

    * (B) Factors necessary for the coordination of such benefits with other items and services including those furnished in-person.

    * (C) Such other areas as determined by the Secretary.

* #### (4) Enrollee choice
  * If an MA plan provides a service as an additional telehealth benefit (as defined in paragraph (2))—

    * (A) the MA plan shall also provide access to such benefit through an in-person visit (and not only as an additional telehealth benefit); and

    * (B) an individual enrollee shall have discretion as to whether to receive such service through the in-person visit or as an additional telehealth benefit.

* #### (5) Treatment under MA
  * For purposes of this subsection and section 1395w–24 of this title, if a plan provides additional telehealth benefits, such additional telehealth benefits shall be treated as if they were benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option.

* #### (6) Construction
  * Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that MA plans provide enrollees with items and services (other than hospice care) for which benefits are available under parts A and B, including benefits available under section 1395m(m) of this title.

#### (n) Provision of information relating to the safe disposal of certain prescription drugs
* #### (1) In general
  * In the case of an individual enrolled under an MA or MA–PD plan who is furnished an in-home health risk assessment on or after January 1, 2021, such plan shall ensure that such assessment includes information on the safe disposal of prescription drugs that are controlled substances that meets the criteria established under paragraph (2). Such information shall include information on drug takeback programs that meet such requirements determined appropriate by the Secretary and information on in-home disposal.

* #### (2) Criteria
  * The Secretary shall, through rulemaking, establish criteria the Secretary determines appropriate with respect to information provided to an individual to ensure that such information sufficiently educates such individual on the safe disposal of prescription drugs that are controlled substances.

    * #### (i) Payment before 2006
      * For years before 2006, the payment amount shall be equal to 1/12 of the annual MA capitation rate (as calculated under subsection (c)(1)) with respect to that individual for that area, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and reduced by the amount of any reduction elected under section 1395w–24(f)(1)(E) of this title.

    * #### (ii) Payment for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006
      * For years beginning with 2006, the amount specified in subparagraph (B).

  * #### (B) Payment amount for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006
    * #### (i) Payment of bid for plans with bids below benchmark
      * In the case of a plan for which there are average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w–24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w–24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G), plus the amount (if any) of any rebate under subparagraph (E).

    * #### (ii) Payment of benchmark for plans with bids at or above benchmark
      * In the case of a plan for which there are no average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w–24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w–24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G).

    * #### (iii) Payment of benchmark for MSA plans
      * Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), in the case of an MSA plan, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C).

    * #### (iv) Authority to apply frailty adjustment under PACE payment rules for certain specialized MA plans for special needs individuals
      * #### (I) In general
        * Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, for plan year 2011 and subsequent plan years, in the case of a plan described in subclause (II), the Secretary may apply the payment rules under section 1395eee(d) of this title (other than paragraph (3) of such section) rather than the payment rules that would otherwise apply under this part, but only to the extent necessary to reflect the costs of treating high concentrations of frail individuals.

      * #### (II) Plan described
        * A plan described in this subclause is a specialized MA plan for special needs individuals described in section 1395w–28(b)(6)(B)(ii) of this title that is fully integrated with capitated contracts with States for Medicaid benefits, including long-term care, and that have similar average levels of frailty (as determined by the Secretary) as the PACE program.

  * #### (C) Demographic adjustment, including adjustment for health status
    * #### (i) In general
      * Subject to subparagraph (I), the Secretary shall adjust the payment amount under subparagraph (A)(i) and the amount specified under subparagraph (B)(i), (B)(ii), and (B)(iii) for such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, including adjustment for health status under paragraph (3), so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such adjustment factors if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.

    * #### (ii) Application of coding adjustment
      * For 2006 and each subsequent year:

        * (I) In applying the adjustment under clause (i) for health status to payment amounts, the Secretary shall ensure that such adjustment reflects changes in treatment and coding practices in the fee-for-service sector and reflects differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage plans and providers under part A and B to the extent that the Secretary has identified such differences.

        * (II) In order to ensure payment accuracy, the Secretary shall annually conduct an analysis of the differences described in subclause (I). The Secretary shall complete such analysis by a date necessary to ensure that the results of such analysis are incorporated on a timely basis into the risk scores for 2008 and subsequent years. In conducting such analysis, the Secretary shall use data submitted with respect to 2004 and subsequent years, as available and updated as appropriate.

        * (III) In calculating each year's adjustment, the adjustment factor shall be for 2014, not less than the adjustment factor applied for 2010, plus 1.5 percentage points; for each of years 2015 through 2018, not less than the adjustment factor applied for the previous year, plus 0.25 percentage point; and for 2019 and each subsequent year, not less than 5.9 percent.

        * (IV) Such adjustment shall be applied to risk scores until the Secretary implements risk adjustment using Medicare Advantage diagnostic, cost, and use data.

    * #### (iii) Improvements to risk adjustment for special needs individuals with chronic health conditions
      * #### (I) In general
        * For 2011 and subsequent years, for purposes of the adjustment under clause (i) with respect to individuals described in subclause (II), the Secretary shall use a risk score that reflects the known underlying risk profile and chronic health status of similar individuals. Such risk score shall be used instead of the default risk score for new enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans that are not specialized MA plans for special needs individuals (as defined in section 1395w–28(b)(6) of this title).

      * #### (II) Individuals described
        * An individual described in this subclause is a special needs individual described in subsection (b)(6)(B)(iii) who enrolls in a specialized MA plan for special needs individuals on or after January 1, 2011.

      * #### (III) Evaluation
        * For 2011 and periodically thereafter, the Secretary shall evaluate and revise the risk adjustment system under this subparagraph in order to, as accurately as possible, account for higher medical and care coordination costs associated with frailty, individuals with multiple, comorbid chronic conditions, and individuals with a diagnosis of mental illness, and also to account for costs that may be associated with higher concentrations of beneficiaries with those conditions.

      * #### (IV) Publication of evaluation and revisions
        * The Secretary shall publish, as part of an announcement under subsection (b), a description of any evaluation conducted under subclause (III) during the preceding year and any revisions made under such subclause as a result of such evaluation.

  * #### (D) Separate payment for Federal drug subsidies
    * In the case of an enrollee in an MA–PD plan, the MA organization offering such plan also receives—

      * (i) subsidies under section 1395w–115 of this title (other than under subsection (g)); and

      * (ii) reimbursement for premium and cost-sharing reductions for low-income individuals under section 1395w–114(c)(1)(C) of this title.

  * #### (F) Adjustment for intra-area variations
    * #### (i) Intra-regional variations
      * In the case of payment with respect to an MA regional plan for an MA region, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such region.

    * #### (ii) Intra-service area variations
      * In the case of payment with respect to an MA local plan for a service area that covers more than one MA local area, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such service area.

  * #### (G) Adjustment relating to risk adjustment
    * The Secretary shall adjust payments with respect to MA plans as necessary to ensure that—

      * (i) the sum of—

        * (I) the monthly payment made under subparagraph (A)(ii); and

        * (II) the MA monthly basic beneficiary premium under section 1395w–24(b)(2)(A) of this title; equals


      * (ii) the unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, adjusted in the manner described in subparagraph (C) and, for an MA regional plan, subparagraph (F).

  * #### (H) Special rule for end-stage renal disease
    * The Secretary shall establish separate rates of payment to a Medicare+Choice organization with respect to classes of individuals determined to have end-stage renal disease and enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization. Such rates of payment shall be actuarially equivalent to rates that would have been paid with respect to other enrollees in the MA payment area (or such other area as specified by the Secretary) under the provisions of this section as in effect before December 8, 2003. In accordance with regulations, the Secretary shall provide for the application of the seventh sentence of section 1395rr(b)(7) of this title to payments under this section covering the provision of renal dialysis treatment in the same manner as such sentence applies to composite rate payments described in such sentence. In establishing such rates, the Secretary shall provide for appropriate adjustments to increase each rate to reflect the demonstration rate (including the risk adjustment methodology associated with such rate) of the social health maintenance organization end-stage renal disease capitation demonstrations (established by section 2355 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, as amended by section 13567(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993), and shall compute such rates by taking into account such factors as renal treatment modality, age, and the underlying cause of the end-stage renal disease. The Secretary may apply the competitive bidding methodology provided for in this section, with appropriate adjustments to account for the risk adjustment methodology applied to end stage renal disease payments.

* #### (2) Adjustment to reflect number of enrollees
  * #### (A) In general
    * The amount of payment under this subsection may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled with an organization under this part and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.

  * #### (B) Special rule for certain enrollees
    * #### (i) In general
      * Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under subparagraph (A) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with a Medicare+Choice organization under a plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the organization under this part, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this subparagraph, such period may not exceed 90 days.

    * #### (ii) Exception
      * No adjustment may be made under clause (i) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the disclosure statement described in section 1395w–22(c) of this title at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.

      * (i) for 1998 is, subject to subparagraph (D), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for 1998 (described in paragraph (6)(A)); or

      * (ii) for a subsequent year is the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the previous year determined under this paragraph for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for such subsequent year.

  * #### (B) Removal of medical education from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost
    * #### (i) In general
      * In determining the area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 1998), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to exclude from the rate the applicable percent (specified in clause (ii)) of the payment adjustments described in subparagraph (C).

    * #### (ii) Applicable percent

  * #### (C) Payment adjustment
    * #### (i) In general
      * Subject to clause (ii), the payment adjustments described in this subparagraph are payment adjustments which the Secretary estimates were payable during 1997—

        * (I) for the indirect costs of medical education under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title, and

        * (II) for direct graduate medical education costs under section 1395ww(h) of this title.

    * #### (ii) Treatment of payments covered under State hospital reimbursement system
      * To the extent that the Secretary estimates that an annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 described in clause (i) reflects payments to hospitals reimbursed under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall estimate a payment adjustment that is comparable to the payment adjustment that would have been made under clause (i) if the hospitals had not been reimbursed under such section.

  * #### (D) Treatment of areas with highly variable payment rates
    * In the case of a Medicare+Choice payment area for which the annual per capita rate of payment determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for 1997 varies by more than 20 percent from such rate for 1996, for purposes of this subsection the Secretary may substitute for such rate for 1997 a rate that is more representative of the costs of the enrollees in the area.

  * #### (E) Inclusion of costs of DOD and VA military facility services to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries
    * In determining the area-specific MA capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 2004), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to include in the rate the Secretary's estimate, on a per capita basis, of the amount of additional payments that would have been made in the area involved under this subchapter if individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter had not received services from facilities of the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs.

* #### (4) Input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate
  * #### (A) In general
    * For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a year is equal to the sum, for all the types of medicare services (as classified by the Secretary), of the product (for each such type of service) of—

      * (i) the national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (determined under subparagraph (B)) for the year,

      * (ii) the proportion of such rate for the year which is attributable to such type of services, and

      * (iii) an index that reflects (for that year and that type of services) the relative input price of such services in the area compared to the national average input price of such services.


  * In applying clause (iii), the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), apply those indices under this subchapter that are used in applying (or updating) national payment rates for specific areas and localities.

  * #### (B) National standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate
    * In subparagraph (A)(i), the "national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate" for a year is equal to—

      * (i) the sum (for all Medicare+Choice payment areas) of the product of—

        * (I) the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for that year for the area under paragraph (3), and

        * (II) the average number of medicare beneficiaries residing in that area in the year, multiplied by the average of the risk factor weights used to adjust payments under subsection (a)(1)(A) for such beneficiaries in such area; divided by


      * (ii) the sum of the products described in clause (i)(II) for all areas for that year.

  * #### (C) Special rules for 1998

      * (ii) the proportions described in subparagraph (A)(ii)—

        * (I) for part A services shall be the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the national average annual per capita rate of payment for part A for 1997 to the total national average annual per capita rate of payment for parts A and B for 1997, and

        * (II) for part B services shall be 100 percent minus the ratio described in subclause (I);


      * (iii) for part A services, 70 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index used under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title to adjust payment rates for relative hospital wage levels for hospitals located in the payment area involved;

      * (iv) for part B services—

        * (I) 66 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index of the geographic area factors under section 1395w–4(e) of this title used to adjust payment rates for physicians' services furnished in the payment area, and

        * (II) of the remaining 34 percent of the amount of such payments, 40 percent shall be adjusted by the index described in clause (iii); and


      * (v) the index values shall be computed based only on the beneficiary population who are 65 years of age or older and who are not determined to have end stage renal disease.


  * The Secretary may continue to apply the rules described in this subparagraph (or similar rules) for 1999.

* #### (5) Payment adjustment budget neutrality factor
  * For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), for each year (other than 2004), the Secretary shall determine a budget neutrality adjustment factor so that the aggregate of the payments under this part (other than those attributable to subsections (a)(3)(C)(iv), (a)(4), and (i)) shall equal the aggregate payments that would have been made under this part if payment were based entirely on area-specific capitation rates.

* #### (6) "National per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage" defined
  * #### (A) In general
    * In this part, the "national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage" for a year is the percentage determined by the Secretary, by March 1st before the beginning of the year involved, to reflect the Secretary's estimate of the projected per capita rate of growth in expenditures under this subchapter for an individual entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B, excluding expenditures attributable to subsections (a)(7) and (o) of section 1395w–4 of this title and subsections (b)(3)(B)(ix) and (n) of section 1395ww of this title, reduced by the number of percentage points specified in subparagraph (B) for the year. Separate determinations may be made for aged enrollees, disabled enrollees, and enrollees with end-stage renal disease.

      * Subject to clause (ii), as part of providing any additional benefits required under subparagraph (A), a Medicare+Choice organization may elect a reduction in its payments under section 1395w–23(a)(1)(A) of this title with respect to a Medicare+Choice plan and the Secretary shall apply such reduction to reduce the premium under section 1395r of this title of each enrollee in such plan as provided in section 1395s(i) of this title.

    * #### (ii) Amount of reduction
      * The amount of the reduction under clause (i) with respect to any enrollee in a Medicare+Choice plan—

        * (I) may not exceed 125 percent of the premium described under section 1395r(a)(3) of this title; and

        * (II) shall apply uniformly to each enrollee of the Medicare+Choice plan to which such reduction applies.

  * #### (F) Construction
    * Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in section 1395w–22(a)(3) of this title) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.

* #### (2) Stabilization fund
  * A Medicare+Choice organization may provide that a part of the value of an excess amount described in paragraph (1) be withheld and reserved in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (in such proportions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) by the Secretary for subsequent annual contract periods, to the extent required to stabilize and prevent undue fluctuations in the additional benefits offered in those subsequent periods by the organization in accordance with such paragraph. Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.

* #### (3) Adjusted community rate
  * For purposes of this subsection, subject to paragraph (4), the term "adjusted community rate" for a service or services means, at the election of a Medicare+Choice organization, either—

    * (A) the rate of payment for that service or services which the Secretary annually determines would apply to an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under this part if the rate of payment were determined under a "community rating system" (as defined in section 300e–1(8) of this title, other than subparagraph (C)), or

    * (B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services,


* but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).

* #### (4) Determination based on insufficient data
  * For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.

#### (g) Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes
* No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w–23 of this title or premiums paid to such organizations under this part.

#### (h) Permitting use of segments of service areas
* The Secretary shall permit a Medicare+Choice organization to elect to apply the provisions of this section uniformly to separate segments of a service area (rather than uniformly to an entire service area) as long as such segments are composed of one or more Medicare+Choice payment areas.

### §1395w–25. Organizational and financial requirements for Medicare+Choice organizations; provider-sponsored organizations
#### (a) Organized and licensed under State law
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a Medicare+Choice organization shall be organized and licensed under State law as a risk-bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers a Medicare+Choice plan.

* #### (2) Special exception for provider-sponsored organizations
  * #### (A) In general
    * In the case of a provider-sponsored organization that seeks to offer a Medicare+Choice plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of paragraph (1) that the organization be licensed in that State if—

      * (i) the organization files an application for such waiver with the Secretary by not later than November 1, 2002, and

      * (ii) the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) has been met.

  * #### (B) Failure to act on licensure application on a timely basis
    * The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has failed to complete action on a licensing application of the organization within 90 days of the date of the State's receipt of a substantially complete application. No period before August 5, 1997, shall be included in determining such 90-day period.

  * #### (C) Denial of application based on discriminatory treatment
    * The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application and—

      * (i) the standards or review process imposed by the State as a condition of approval of the license imposes any material requirements, procedures, or standards (other than solvency requirements) to such organizations that are not generally applicable to other entities engaged in a substantially similar business, or

      * (ii) the State requires the organization, as a condition of licensure, to offer any product or plan other than a Medicare+Choice plan.

  * #### (D) Denial of application based on application of solvency requirements
    * With respect to waiver applications filed on or after the date of publication of solvency standards under section 1395w–26(a) of this title, the ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application based (in whole or in part) on the organization's failure to meet applicable solvency requirements and—

      * (i) such requirements are not the same as the solvency standards established under section 1395w–26(a) of this title; or

      * (ii) the State has imposed as a condition of approval of the license documentation or information requirements relating to solvency or other material requirements, procedures, or standards relating to solvency that are different from the requirements, procedures, and standards applied by the Secretary under subsection (d)(2).


  * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "solvency requirements" means requirements relating to solvency and other matters covered under the standards established under section 1395w–26(a) of this title.

  * #### (E) Treatment of waiver
    * In the case of a waiver granted under this paragraph for a provider-sponsored organization with respect to a State—

    * #### (i) Limitation to State
      * The waiver shall be effective only with respect to that State and does not apply to any other State.

    * #### (ii) Limitation to 36-month period
      * The waiver shall be effective only for a 36-month period and may not be renewed.

    * #### (iii) Conditioned on compliance with consumer protection and quality standards
      * The continuation of the waiver is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with the requirements described in subparagraph (G).

    * #### (iv) Preemption of State law
      * Any provisions of law of that State which relate to the licensing of the organization and which prohibit the organization from providing coverage pursuant to a contract under this part shall be superseded.

  * #### (F) Prompt action on application
    * The Secretary shall grant or deny such a waiver application within 60 days after the date the Secretary determines that a substantially complete waiver application has been filed. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an organization which has had such a waiver application denied from submitting a subsequent waiver application.

  * #### (G) Application and enforcement of State consumer protection and quality standards
    * #### (i) In general
      * A waiver granted under this paragraph to an organization with respect to licensing under State law is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with all consumer protection and quality standards insofar as such standards—

        * (I) would apply in the State to the organization if it were licensed under State law;

        * (II) are generally applicable to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans in the State; and

        * (III) are consistent with the standards established under this part.


  * &nbsp;Such standards shall not include any standard preempted under section 1395w–26(b)(3)(B) of this title.

    * #### (ii) Incorporation into contract
      * In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary shall incorporate the requirement that the organization (and Medicare+Choice plans it offers) comply with standards under clause (i) as part of the contract between the Secretary and the organization under section 1395w–27 of this title.

    * #### (iii) Enforcement
      * In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State under which the State agrees to provide for monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to compliance of such an organization and its Medicare+Choice plans with such standards. Such monitoring and enforcement shall be conducted by the State in the same manner as the State enforces such standards with respect to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans, without discrimination based on the type of organization to which the standards apply. Such an agreement shall specify or establish mechanisms by which compliance activities are undertaken, while not lengthening the time required to review and process applications for waivers under this paragraph.

  * #### (H) Report
    * By not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report regarding whether the waiver process under this paragraph should be continued after December 31, 2002. In making such recommendation, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors, the impact of such process on beneficiaries and on the long-term solvency of the program under this subchapter.

* #### (3) Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification
  * The fact that an organization is licensed in accordance with paragraph (1) does not deem the organization to meet other requirements imposed under this part.

#### (b) Assumption of full financial risk
* The Medicare+Choice organization shall assume full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of the health care services for which benefits are required to be provided under section 1395w–22(a)(1) of this title, except that the organization—

  * (1) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of providing to any enrolled member such services the aggregate value of which exceeds such aggregate level as the Secretary specifies from time to time,

  * (2) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of such services provided to its enrolled members other than through the organization because medical necessity required their provision before they could be secured through the organization,

  * (3) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for not more than 90 percent of the amount by which its costs for any of its fiscal years exceed 115 percent of its income for such fiscal year, and

  * (4) may make arrangements with physicians or other health care professionals, health care institutions, or any combination of such individuals or institutions to assume all or part of the financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic health services by the physicians or other health professionals or through the institutions.

#### (c) Certification of provision against risk of insolvency for unlicensed PSOs
* #### (1) In general
  * Each Medicare+Choice organization that is a provider-sponsored organization, that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a), and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (a)(2), shall meet standards established under section 1395w–26(a) of this title relating to the financial solvency and capital adequacy of the organization.

* #### (2) Certification process for solvency standards for PSOs
  * The Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt and approval of applications of a provider-sponsored organization described in paragraph (1) for certification (and periodic recertification) of the organization as meeting such solvency standards. Under such process, the Secretary shall act upon such a certification application not later than 60 days after the date the application has been received.

* #### (1) In general
  * In this part, the term "provider-sponsored organization" means a public or private entity—

    * (A) that is established or organized, and operated, by a health care provider, or group of affiliated health care providers,

    * (C) with respect to which the affiliated providers share, directly or indirectly, substantial financial risk with respect to the provision of such items and services and have at least a majority financial interest in the entity.

* #### (2) Substantial proportion
  * In defining what is a "substantial proportion" for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary—

    * (A) shall take into account the need for such an organization to assume responsibility for providing—

      * (i) significantly more than the majority of the items and services under the contract under this section through its own affiliated providers; and

      * (ii) most of the remainder of the items and services under the contract through providers with which the organization has an agreement to provide such items and services,


  * in order to assure financial stability and to address the practical considerations involved in integrating the delivery of a wide range of service providers;

    * (B) shall take into account the need for such an organization to provide a limited proportion of the items and services under the contract through providers that are neither affiliated with nor have an agreement with the organization; and

    * (C) may allow for variation in the definition of substantial proportion among such organizations based on relevant differences among the organizations, such as their location in an urban or rural area.

* #### (3) Affiliation
  * For purposes of this subsection, a provider is "affiliated" with another provider if, through contract, ownership, or otherwise—

    * (A) one provider, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other,

    * (B) both providers are part of a controlled group of corporations under section 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

    * (B) any entity that is engaged in the delivery of health care services in a State and that, if it is required by State law or regulation to be licensed or certified by the State to engage in the delivery of such services in the State, is so licensed.

* #### (6) Regulations
  * The Secretary shall issue regulations to carry out this subsection.

  * #### (B) Factors to consider for solvency standards
    * In establishing solvency standards under subparagraph (A) for provider-sponsored organizations, the Secretary shall consult with interested parties and shall take into account—

      * (ii) alternative means of protecting against insolvency, including reinsurance, unrestricted surplus, letters of credit, guarantees, organizational insurance coverage, partnerships with other licensed entities, and valuation attributable to the ability of such an organization to meet its service obligations through direct delivery of care, and

      * (iii) any standards developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners specifically for risk-based health care delivery organizations.
