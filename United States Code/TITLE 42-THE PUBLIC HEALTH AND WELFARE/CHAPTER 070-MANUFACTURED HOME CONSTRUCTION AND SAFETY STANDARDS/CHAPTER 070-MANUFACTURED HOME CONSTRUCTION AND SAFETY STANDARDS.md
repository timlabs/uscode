  * (2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate;

  * (3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable for the particular type of manufactured home or for the geographic region for which it is prescribed;

  * (4) consider the probable effect of such standard on the cost of the manufactured home to the public; and

  * (5) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purposes of this chapter.

#### (f) Coverage; exclusion
* The Secretary shall exclude from the coverage of this chapter any structure which the manufacturer certifies, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, to be:

  * (1) designed only for erection or installation on a site-built permanent foundation;

  * (2) not designed to be moved once so erected or installed;

  * (3) designed and manufactured to comply with a nationally recognized model building code or an equivalent local code, or with a State or local modular building code recognized as generally equivalent to building codes for site-built housing, or with minimum property standards adopted by the Secretary pursuant to title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; and
