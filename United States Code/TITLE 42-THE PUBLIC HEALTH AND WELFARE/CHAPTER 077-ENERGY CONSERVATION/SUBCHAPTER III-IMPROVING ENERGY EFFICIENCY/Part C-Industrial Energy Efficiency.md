#### (c) Other Federal assistance
* #### (1) Assessment criteria
  * Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall, by contract with nonprofit organizations with expertise in process-oriented industrial energy efficiency technologies, establish and, as appropriate, update criteria for conducting process-oriented industrial assessments on an industry-by-industry basis. Such criteria shall be made available to State and local government, public utility commissions, utilities, representatives of affected process-oriented industries, and other interested parties.

* #### (2) Directory
  * The Secretary shall establish a nationwide directory of organizations offering industrial energy efficiency assessments, technologies, and services consistent with the purposes of this section. Such directory shall be made available to State governments, public utility commissions, utilities, industry representatives, and other interested parties.

* #### (3) Award program
  * The Secretary shall establish an annual award program to recognize utilities operating outstanding or innovative industrial energy efficiency technology assistance programs.
