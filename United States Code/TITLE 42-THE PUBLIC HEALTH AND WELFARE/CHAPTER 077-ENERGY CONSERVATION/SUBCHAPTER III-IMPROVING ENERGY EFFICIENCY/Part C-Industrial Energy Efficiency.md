#### (c) Other Federal assistance
* #### (1) Assessment criteria
  * Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall, by contract with nonprofit organizations with expertise in process-oriented industrial energy efficiency technologies, establish and, as appropriate, update criteria for conducting process-oriented industrial assessments on an industry-by-industry basis. Such criteria shall be made available to State and local government, public utility commissions, utilities, representatives of affected process-oriented industries, and other interested parties.

* #### (2) Directory
  * The Secretary shall establish a nationwide directory of organizations offering industrial energy efficiency assessments, technologies, and services consistent with the purposes of this section. Such directory shall be made available to State governments, public utility commissions, utilities, industry representatives, and other interested parties.

* #### (3) Award program
  * The Secretary shall establish an annual award program to recognize utilities operating outstanding or innovative industrial energy efficiency technology assistance programs.

* #### (4) Meetings
  * In order to further the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall convene annual meetings of parties interested in process-oriented industrial assessments, including representatives of State government, public utility commissions, utilities, and affected process-oriented industries.

#### (d) Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

### §6350. Industrial insulation and audit guidelines
#### (a) Voluntary guidelines for energy efficiency auditing and insulating
* Not later than 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, after consultation with utilities, major industrial energy consumers, and representatives of the insulation industry, shall establish voluntary guidelines for—

  * (1) the conduct of energy efficiency audits of industrial facilities to identify cost-effective opportunities to increase energy efficiency; and

  * (2) the installation of insulation to achieve cost-effective increases in energy efficiency in industrial facilities.

#### (b) Educational and technical assistance
* The Secretary shall conduct a program of educational and technical assistance to promote the use of the voluntary guidelines established under subsection (a).
