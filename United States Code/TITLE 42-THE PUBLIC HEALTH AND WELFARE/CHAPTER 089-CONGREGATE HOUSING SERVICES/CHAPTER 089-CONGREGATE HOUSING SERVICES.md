### §8011. Revised congregate housing services program
#### (a) Findings and purposes
* #### (1) Findings
  * The Congress finds that—

    * (A) the effective provision of congregate services may require the redesign of units and buildings to meet the special physical needs of the frail elderly persons and the creation of congregate space to accommodate services that enhance independent living;

    * (C) independent living with assistance is a preferable housing alternative to institutionalization for many frail older persons and persons with disabilities;

    * (D) 365,000 persons in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty, and the number is expected to increase as the general population ages;

    * (E) an estimated 20 to 30 percent of older adults living in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty;
