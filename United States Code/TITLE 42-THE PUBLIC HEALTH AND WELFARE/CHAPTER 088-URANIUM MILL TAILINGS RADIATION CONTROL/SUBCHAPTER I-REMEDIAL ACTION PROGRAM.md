#### (b) Identification of sites; Federal agency jurisdiction; contents; duplication prohibition; use and cooperation respecting other Federal agency information
* Not later than July 1, 1979, the Secretary shall provide a report to the Congress which identifies all sites located on public or acquired lands of the United States containing residual radioactive materials and other raidoactive waste (other than waste resulting from the production of electric energy) and specifies which Federal agency has jurisdiction over such sites. The report shall include the identity of property and other structures in the vicinity of such site that are contaminated or may be contaminated by such materials and the actions planned or taken to remove such materials. The report shall describe in what manner such sites are adequately stabilized and otherwise controlled to prevent radon diffusion from such sites into the environment and other environmental harm. If any site is not so stabilized or controlled, the report shall describe the remedial actions planned for such site and the time frame for performing such actions. In preparing the reports under this section, the Secretary shall avoid duplication of previous or ongoing studies and shall utilize all information available from other departments and agencies of the United States respecting the subject matter of such report. Such agencies shall cooperate with the Secretary in the preparation of such report and furnish such information as available to them and necessary for such report.

* The Commission, in cooperation with the Secretary, shall ensure that any relevant information, other than trade secrets and other proprietary information otherwise exempted from mandatory disclosure under any other provision of law, obtained from the conduct of each of the remedial actions authorized by this subchapter and the subsequent perpetual care of those residual radioactive materials is documented systematically, and made publicly available conveniently for use.

### §7925. Active operations; liability for remedial action
* (a) No amount may be expended under this subchapter with respect to any site licensed by the Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.] or by a State as permitted under section 274 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 2021] at which production of any uranium product from ores (other than from residual radioactive materials) takes place. This subsection does not prohibit the disposal of residual radioactive material from a processing site under this subchapter at a site licensed under title II or the expenditure of funds under this subchapter for such disposal.

* (b) In the case of each processing site designated under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall conduct a study to determine the identity and legal responsibility which any person (other than the United States, a State, or Indian tribe) who owned or operated or controlled (as determined by the Attorney General) such site before November 8, 1978, may have under any law or rule of law for reclamation or other remedial action with respect to such site. The Attorney General shall publish the results of such study, and provide copies thereof to the Congress, as promptly as practicable following November 8, 1978. The Attorney General, based on such study, shall, to the extent he deems it appropriate and in the public interest, take such action under any provision of law in effect when uranium was produced at such site to require payment by such person of all or any part of the costs incurred by the United States for such remedial action for which he determines such person is liable.
