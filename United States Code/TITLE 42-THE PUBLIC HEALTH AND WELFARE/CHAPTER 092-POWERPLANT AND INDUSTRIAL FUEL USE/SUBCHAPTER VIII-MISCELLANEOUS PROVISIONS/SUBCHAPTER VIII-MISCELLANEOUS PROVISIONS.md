#### (c) Contents of plan
* (1) Any conservation plan under this section shall set forth means determined by the utility to achieve conservation of electric energy not later than the 5th year after its initial approval at a level, measured on an annual basis, at least equal to 10 percent of the electric energy output of that utility during the most recent 4 calendar quarters ending prior to August 13, 1981, which is attributable to natural gas.

* (2) The conservation plan shall include—

  * (A) all activities required for such utility by part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.];
