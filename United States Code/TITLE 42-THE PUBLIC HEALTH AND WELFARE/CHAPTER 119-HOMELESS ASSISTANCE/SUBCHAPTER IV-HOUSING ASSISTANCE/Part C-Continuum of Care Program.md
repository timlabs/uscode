      * (i) preventing homelessness among the subset of such families with children and youth who are at highest risk of becoming homeless, as such term is defined for purposes of this subchapter; or

      * (ii) achieving independent living in permanent housing among such families with children and youth, especially those who have a history of doubled-up and other temporary housing situations or are living in a temporary housing situation due to lack of available and appropriate emergency shelter, through the provision of eligible assistance that directly contributes to achieving such results including assistance to address chronic disabilities, chronic physical health or mental health conditions, substance addiction, histories of domestic violence or childhood abuse, or multiple barriers to employment; and


    * (G) such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to carry out this part in an effective and efficient manner.

  * In addition to the criteria required under paragraph (1), the criteria established under paragraph (1) shall also include the need within the geographic area for homeless services, determined as follows and under the following conditions:

  * #### (A) Notice
    * The Secretary shall inform each collaborative applicant, at a time concurrent with the release of the notice of funding availability for the grants, of the pro rata estimated grant amount under this part for the geographic area represented by the collaborative applicant.

  * #### (B) Amount
    * #### (i) Formula
      * Such estimated grant amounts shall be determined by a formula, which shall be developed by the Secretary, by regulation, not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning upon May 20, 2009, that is based upon factors that are appropriate to allocate funds to meet the goals and objectives of this part.

    * #### (ii) Combinations or consortia
      * For a collaborative applicant that represents a combination or consortium of cities or counties, the estimated need amount shall be the sum of the estimated need amounts for the cities or counties represented by the collaborative applicant.

    * #### (iii) Authority of Secretary
      * Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall increase the estimated need amount for a geographic area if necessary to provide 1 year of renewal funding for all expiring contracts entered into under this part for the geographic area.

* #### (3) Homelessness counts
  * The Secretary shall not require that communities conduct an actual count of homeless people other than those described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 11302(a) of this title.

#### (c) Adjustments
* The Secretary may adjust the formula described in subsection (b)(2) as necessary—

  * (1) to ensure that each collaborative applicant has sufficient funding to renew all qualified projects for at least one year; and

  * (2) to ensure that collaborative applicants are not discouraged from replacing renewal projects with new projects that the collaborative applicant determines will better be able to meet the purposes of this chapter.

### §11386b. Allocation of amounts and incentives for specific eligible activities
#### (a) Minimum allocation for permanent housing for homeless individuals and families with disabilities
* #### (1) In general
  * From the amounts made available to carry out this part for a fiscal year, a portion equal to not less than 30 percent of the sums made available to carry out part B and this part, shall be used for permanent housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and homeless families that include such an individual who is an adult or a minor head of household if no adult is present in the household.

* #### (2) Calculation
  * In calculating the portion of the amount described in paragraph (1) that is used for activities that are described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall not count funds made available to renew contracts for existing projects under section 11386c of this title.

* #### (3) Adjustment
  * The 30 percent figure in paragraph (1) shall be reduced proportionately based on need under section 11386a(b)(2) of this title in geographic areas for which subsection (e) applies in regard to subsection (d)(2)(A).

* #### (4) Suspension
  * The requirement established in paragraph (1) shall be suspended for any year in which funding available for grants under this part after making the allocation established in paragraph (1) would not be sufficient to renew for 1 year all existing grants that would otherwise be fully funded under this part.

* #### (5) Termination
  * The requirement established in paragraph (1) shall terminate upon a finding by the Secretary that since the beginning of 2001 at least 150,000 new units of permanent housing for homeless individuals and families with disabilities have been funded under this part.

#### (b) Set-aside for permanent housing for homeless families with children
* From the amounts made available to carry out this part for a fiscal year, a portion equal to not less than 10 percent of the sums made available to carry out part B and this part for that fiscal year shall be used to provide or secure permanent housing for homeless families with children.

#### (c) Treatment of amounts for permanent or transitional housing
* Nothing in this chapter may be construed to establish a limit on the amount of funding that an applicant may request under this part for acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation activities for the development of permanent housing or transitional housing.

#### (d) Incentives for proven strategies
* #### (1) In general
  * The Secretary shall provide bonuses or other incentives to geographic areas for using funding under this part for activities that have been proven to be effective at reducing homelessness generally, reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation, or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals as set forth in section 11386a(b)(1)(F) of this title.

* #### (2) Rule of construction
  * For purposes of this subsection, activities that have been proven to be effective at reducing homelessness generally or reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation includes—

    * (A) permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals and families;

    * (B) for homeless families, rapid rehousing services, short-term flexible subsidies to overcome barriers to rehousing, support services concentrating on improving incomes to pay rent, coupled with performance measures emphasizing rapid and permanent rehousing and with leveraging funding from mainstream family service systems such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child Welfare services; and

    * (C) any other activity determined by the Secretary, based on research and after notice and comment to the public, to have been proven effective at reducing homelessness generally, reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation, or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals as set forth in section 11386a(b)(1)(F) of this title.

* #### (3) Balance of incentives for proven strategies
  * To the extent practicable, in providing bonuses or incentives for proven strategies, the Secretary shall seek to maintain a balance among strategies targeting homeless individuals, families, and other subpopulations. The Secretary shall not implement bonuses or incentives that specifically discourage collaborative applicants from exercising their flexibility to serve families with children and youth defined as homeless under other Federal statutes.

#### (e) Incentives for successful implementation of proven strategies
* If any geographic area demonstrates that it has fully implemented any of the activities described in subsection (d) for all homeless individuals and families or for all members of subpopulations for whom such activities are targeted, that geographic area shall receive the bonus or incentive provided under subsection (d), but may use such bonus or incentive for any eligible activity under either section 11383 of this title or paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 11374(a) of this title for homeless people generally or for the relevant subpopulation.

### §11386c. Renewal funding and terms of assistance for permanent housing

  * (2) the project complies with program requirements and appropriate standards of housing quality and habitability, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (c) Construction

### §11386d. Matching funding
#### (a) In general
* A collaborative applicant in a geographic area in which funds are awarded under this part shall specify contributions from any source other than a grant awarded under this part, including renewal funding of projects assisted under parts C, D, and F of this subchapter as in effect before the effective date under section 1503 of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009, that shall be made available in the geographic area in an amount equal to not less than 25 percent of the funds provided to recipients in the geographic area, except that grants for leasing shall not be subject to any match requirement.

#### (b) Limitations on in-kind match
