* Not later than 3 years after December 27, 2020, the Secretary of Energy (in this section referred to as the "Secretary"), in consultation with the National Academies, shall develop and complete a national plan for smart manufacturing technology development and deployment to improve the productivity and energy efficiency of the manufacturing sector of the United States.

#### (b) Content
* #### (1) In general
  * The plan developed under subsection (a) shall identify areas in which agency actions by the Secretary and other heads of relevant Federal agencies would—

    * (A) facilitate quicker development, deployment, and adoption of smart manufacturing technologies and processes;

    * (B) result in greater energy efficiency and lower environmental impacts for all American manufacturers; and

    * (C) enhance competitiveness and strengthen the manufacturing sectors of the United States.

* #### (2) Inclusions
  * Agency actions identified under paragraph (1) shall include—

    * (A) an assessment of previous and current actions of the Department relating to smart manufacturing;

    * (B) the establishment of voluntary interconnection protocols and performance standards;

    * (C) the use of smart manufacturing to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in supply chains across multiple companies;

    * (D) actions to increase cybersecurity in smart manufacturing infrastructure;

    * (E) deployment of existing research results;

    * (F) the leveraging of existing high-performance computing infrastructure; and

    * (G) consideration of the impact of smart manufacturing on existing manufacturing jobs and future manufacturing jobs.

#### (c) Biennial revisions
* Not later than 2 years after the date on which the Secretary completes the plan under subsection (a), and not less frequently than once every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall revise the plan to account for advancements in information and communication technology and manufacturing needs.

#### (d) Report
* Annually until the completion of the plan under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the progress made in developing the plan.

#### (e) Definition
* In this section, the term "smart manufacturing" means advanced technologies in information, automation, monitoring, computation, sensing, modeling, artificial intelligence, analytics, and networking that—

  * (1) digitally—

    * (A) simulate manufacturing production lines;

    * (B) operate computer-controlled manufacturing equipment;

    * (C) monitor and communicate production line status; and

    * (D) manage and optimize energy productivity and cost throughout production;


  * (2) model, simulate, and optimize the energy efficiency of a factory building;

  * (3) monitor and optimize building energy performance;

  * (4) model, simulate, and optimize the design of energy efficient and sustainable products, including the use of digital prototyping and additive manufacturing to enhance product design;

  * (5) connect manufactured products in networks to monitor and optimize the performance of the networks, including automated network operations; and

  * (6) digitally connect the supply chain network.
