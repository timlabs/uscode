### PART B—URANIUM REVITALIZATION

### §2296b. Overfeed program
#### (a) Uranium purchases
* To the maximum extent permitted by sound business practice, the Corporation shall purchase uranium in accordance with subsection (b) and overfeed it into the enrichment process to reduce the amount of power required to produce the enriched uranium ordered by enrichment services customers, taking into account costs associated with depleted tailings.

#### (b) Use of domestic uranium
* Uranium purchased by the Corporation for purposes of this section shall be of domestic origin and purchased from domestic uranium producers to the extent permitted under the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19) and the USMCA (as defined in section 4502 of title 19).

### §2296b–1. National Strategic Uranium Reserve
* There is hereby established the National Strategic Uranium Reserve under the direction and control of the Secretary. The Reserve shall consist of natural uranium and uranium equivalents contained in stockpiles or inventories currently held by the United States for defense purposes. Effective on October 24, 1992, and for 6 years thereafter, use of the Reserve shall be restricted to military purposes and government research. Use of the Department of Energy's stockpile of enrichment tails existing on October 24, 1992, shall be restricted to military purposes for 6 years thereafter.

### §2296b–2. Sale of remaining DOE inventories
* The Secretary, after making the transfer required under section 2297c–6 of this title, may sell, from time to time, portions of the remaining inventories of raw or low-enriched uranium of the Department that are not necessary to national security needs, to the Corporation, at a fair market price. Sales under this section may be made only if such sales will not have a substantial adverse impact on the domestic uranium mining industry. Proceeds from sales under this subsection shall be deposited into the general fund of the United States Treasury.

### §2296b–3. Responsibility for the industry
#### (a) Continuing Secretarial responsibility
* The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility for the domestic uranium industry to encourage the use of domestic uranium. The Secretary, in fulfilling this responsibility, shall not use any supervisory authority over the Corporation. The Secretary shall report annually to the appropriate committees of Congress on action taken with respect to the domestic uranium industry, including action to promote the export of domestic uranium pursuant to subsection (b).

#### (b) Encourage export
* The Department, with the cooperation of the Department of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative and other governmental organizations, shall encourage the export of domestic uranium. Within 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall develop recommendations and implement government programs to promote the export of domestic uranium.

### §2296b–4. Annual uranium purchase reports
#### (a) In general
* By January 1 of each year, the owner or operator of any civilian nuclear power reactor shall report to the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, for activities of the previous fiscal year—

  * (1) the country of origin and the seller of any uranium or enriched uranium purchased or imported into the United States either directly or indirectly by such owner or operator; and

  * (2) the country of origin and the seller of any enrichment services purchased by such owner or operator.

#### (b) Congressional access
* The information provided to the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be made available to the Congress by March 1 of each year.

### §2296b–5. Uranium inventory study
* Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a study and report that includes—

  * (1) a comprehensive inventory of all Government owned uranium or uranium equivalents, including natural uranium, depleted tailings, low-enriched uranium, and highly enriched uranium available for conversion to commercial use;

  * (2) a plan for the conversion of inventories of foreign and domestic highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium for commercial use;

  * (3) an estimation of the potential need of the United States for inventories of highly enriched uranium;

  * (4) an analysis and summary of technological requirements and costs associated with converting highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium, including the construction of facilities if necessary;

  * (5) an estimation of potential net proceeds from the conversion and sale of highly enriched uranium;

  * (6) recommendations for implementing a plan to convert highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium; and

  * (7) recommendations for the future use and disposition of such inventories.

### §2296b–6. Regulatory treatment of uranium purchases
#### (a) Encouragement
* The Secretary shall encourage States and utility regulatory authorities to take into consideration the achievement of the objectives and purposes of this part, including the national need to avoid dependence on imports, when considering whether to allow the owner or operator of any electric power plant to recover in its rates and charges to customers any cost of purchase of domestic uranium, enriched uranium, or enrichment services from a non-affiliated seller greater than the cost of non-domestic uranium, enriched uranium or enrichment services.

#### (b) Report
* Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall report to the Congress on the progress of the Secretary in encouraging actions by State regulatory authorities pursuant to subsection (a). Such report shall include detailed information on programs initiated by the Secretary to encourage appropriate State regulatory action and recommendations, if any, on further action that could be taken by the Secretary, other Federal agencies, or the Congress in order to further the purposes of this part.

#### (c) Savings provision
* This section may not be construed to authorize the Secretary to take any action in violation of the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19) or the USMCA (as defined in section 4502 of title 19).
