### **CHAPTER 49—NATIONAL HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS**

### §3931. Congressional statement of purpose
* The Congress finds that the volume of housing being produced for families and individuals of low or moderate income must be increased to meet the national goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family, and declares that it is the policy of the United States to encourage the widest possible participation by private enterprise in the provision of housing for low or moderate income families.
