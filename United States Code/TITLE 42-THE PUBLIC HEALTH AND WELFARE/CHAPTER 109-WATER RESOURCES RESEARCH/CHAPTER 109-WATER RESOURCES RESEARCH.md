### **CHAPTER 109—WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH**

### §10301. Congressional findings and declarations
* The Congress finds and declares that—

  * (1) the existence of an adequate supply of water of good quality for the production of materials and energy for the Nation's needs and for the efficient use of the Nation's energy and water resources is essential to national economic stability and growth, and to the well-being of the people;

  * (2) the management of water resources is closely related to maintaining environmental quality, productivity of natural resources and agricultural systems, and social well-being;

  * (3) there is an increasing threat of impairment to the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources;

  * (4) the Nation's capabilities for technological assessment and planning and for policy formulation for water resources must be strengthened at the Federal, State, and local governmental levels;

  * (5) there should be a continuing national investment in water and related research and technology commensurate with growing national needs;

  * (6) it is necessary to provide for the research and development of technology for the conversion of saline and other impaired waters to a quality suitable for municipal, industrial, agricultural, recreational, and other beneficial uses;

  * (7) the Nation must provide programs to strengthen research and associated graduate education because the pool of scientists, engineers, and technicians trained in fields related to water resources constitutes an invaluable natural resource which should be increased, fully utilized, and regularly replenished; and

  * (8) long-term planning and policy development are essential to ensure the availability of an abundant supply of high quality water for domestic and other uses; and

  * (9) the States must have the research and problem-solving capacity necessary to effectively manage their water resources.

  * (2) cooperate closely with other colleges and universities in the State that have demonstrated capabilities for research, information dissemination, and graduate training in order to develop a statewide program designed to resolve State and regional water and related land problems.


* Each institute shall also cooperate closely with other institutes and other organizations in the region to increase the effectiveness of the institutes and for the purpose of promoting regional coordination.

#### (c) Grants; matching funds
* From the sums appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall make grants to each institute to be matched on a basis of no less than 2 non-Federal dollars for every 1 Federal dollar, such sums to be used only for the reimbursement of the direct cost expenditures incurred for the conduct of the water resources research program.

#### (d) Submission and approval of water research program; requisite assurances
* Prior to and as a condition of the receipt each fiscal year of funds appropriated under subsection (f) of this section, each institute shall submit to the Secretary for his approval a water research program that includes assurances, satisfactory to the Secretary, that such program was developed in close consultation and collaboration with the director of that State's department of water resources or similar agency, other leading water resources officials within the State, and interested members of the public. The program described in the preceding sentence shall include plans to promote research, training, information dissemination, and other activities meeting the needs of the State and Nation, and shall encourage regional cooperation among institutes in research into areas of water management, development, and conservation that have a regional or national character.

#### (e) Evaluation of water resources research program
* The Secretary shall conduct a careful and detailed evaluation of each institute at least once every 3 years to determine that the quality and relevance of its water resources research and its effectiveness at producing measured results and applied water supply research as an institution for planning, conducting, and arranging for research warrants its continued support under this section. If, as a result of any such evaluation, the Secretary determines that an institute does not qualify for further support under this section, then no further grants to the institute may be made until the institute's qualifications are reestablished to the satisfaction of the Secretary.

#### (f) Authorization of appropriations in general

#### (g) Additional appropriations where research focused on water problems of interstate nature
* (1) There is further authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior the sum of $6,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011 only for reimbursement of the direct cost expenses of additional research or synthesis of the results of research by institutes which focuses on water problems and issues of a regional or interstate nature beyond those of concern only to a single State and which relate to specific program priorities identified jointly by the Secretary and the institutes. Such funds when appropriated shall be matched on a not less than dollar-for-dollar basis by funds made available to institutes or groups of institutes, by States or other non-Federal sources. Funds made available under this subsection shall remain available until expended.
