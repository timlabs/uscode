### PART A—INDUSTRY PROGRAM WITH FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

### §4051. Industry flood insurance pool; requirements for participation
* (a) The Administrator is authorized to encourage and otherwise assist any insurance companies and other insurers which meet the requirements prescribed under subsection (b) to form, associate, or otherwise join together in a pool—

  * (1) in order to provide the flood insurance coverage authorized under subchapter I; and

  * (2) for the purpose of assuming, including as reinsurance of coverage provided by the flood insurance program, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, such financial responsibility as will enable such companies and other insurers, with the Federal financial and other assistance available under this chapter, to assume a reasonable proportion of responsibility for the adjustment and payment of claims for losses under the flood insurance program.


* (b) In order to promote the effective administration of the flood insurance program under this part, and to assure that the objectives of this chapter are furthered, the Administrator is authorized to prescribe appropriate requirements for insurance companies and other insurers participating in such pool including, but not limited to, minimum requirements for capital or surplus or assets.

#### (b) Terms and conditions
* Such agreements shall specify—

  * (1) the terms and conditions under which risk capital will be available for the adjustment and payment of claims,

  * (2) the terms and conditions under which the pool (and the companies and other insurers participating therein) shall participate in premiums received and profits or losses realized or sustained,

  * (3) the maximum amount of profit, established by the Administrator and set forth in the schedules prescribed under section 4018 of this title, which may be realized by such pool (and the companies and other insurers participating therein),

  * (4) the terms and conditions under which operating costs and allowances set forth in the schedules prescribed under section 4018 of this title may be paid, and

#### (c) Additional provisions
* In addition, such agreements shall contain such provisions as the Administrator finds necessary to assure that—

  * (1) no insurance company or other insurer which meets the requirements prescribed under section 4051(b) of this title, and which has indicated an intention to participate in the flood insurance program on a risk-sharing basis, will be excluded from participating in the pool,

  * (2) the insurance companies and other insurers participating in the pool will take whatever action may be necessary to provide continuity of flood insurance coverage or reinsurance by the pool, and

  * (3) any insurance companies and other insurers, insurance agents and brokers, and insurance adjustment organizations will be permitted to cooperate with the pool as fiscal agents or otherwise, on other than a risk-sharing basis, to the maximum extent practicable.

### §4053. Adjustment and payment of claims; judicial review; limitations; jurisdiction
* The insurance companies and other insurers which form, associate, or otherwise join together in the pool under this part may adjust and pay all claims for proved and approved losses covered by flood insurance in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and, upon the disallowance by any such company or other insurer of any such claim, or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the amount allowed upon any such claim, the claimant, within one year after the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial disallowance of the claim, may institute an action on such claim against such company or other insurer in the United States district court for the district in which the insured property or the major part thereof shall have been situated, and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action without regard to the amount in controversy.

  * The Administrator is authorized to take such action as may be necessary in order to make available, to the pool formed or otherwise created under section 4051 of this title, reinsurance for losses (due to claims for proved and approved losses covered by flood insurance) which are in excess of losses assumed by such pool in accordance with the excess loss agreement entered into under subsection (c).

* #### (2) Private reinsurance
  * The Administrator is authorized to secure reinsurance of coverage provided by the flood insurance program from the private market at rates and on terms determined by the Administrator to be reasonable and appropriate, in an amount sufficient to maintain the ability of the program to pay claims.
