#### (d) Parishes of Louisiana; premium rates
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any structure existing on December 31, 1973, and located within Avoyelles, Evangeline, Rapides, or Saint Landry Parish in the State of Louisiana, which the Secretary determines is subject to additional flood hazards as a result of the construction or operation of the Atchafalaya Basin Levee System, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates that shall not exceed those which would be applicable if such additional hazards did not exist.

#### (e) Eligibility of community making adequate progress on construction of flood protection system for rates not exceeding those applicable to completed flood protection system; determination of adequate progress
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any community that has made adequate progress, acceptable to the Administrator, on the construction or reconstruction of a flood protection system which will afford flood protection for the one-hundred year frequency flood as determined by the Administrator, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates not exceeding those which would be applicable under this section if such flood protection system had been completed. The Administrator shall find that adequate progress on the construction or reconstruction of a flood protection system, based on the present value of the completed flood protection system, has been made only if: (1) 100 percent of the cost of the system has been authorized; (2) at least 60 percent of the cost of the system has been appropriated; (3) at least 50 percent of the cost of the system has been expended; and (4) the system is at least 50 percent completed. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in determining whether a community has made adequate progress on the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of a flood protection system, the Administrator shall consider all sources of funding, including Federal, State, and local funds.

#### (f) Availability of flood insurance in communities restoring disaccredited flood protection systems; criteria; rates
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this subsection shall apply to riverine and coastal levees that are located in a community which has been determined by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a flood protection system that had been previously accredited on a Flood Insurance Rate Map as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so, and shall apply without regard to the level of Federal funding of or participation in the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of the flood protection system. Except as provided in this subsection, in such a community, flood insurance shall be made available to those properties impacted by the disaccreditation of the flood protection system at premium rates that do not exceed those which would be applicable to any property located in an area of special flood hazard, the construction of which was started prior to the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Administrator for the community in which such property is located. A revised Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be prepared for the community to delineate as Zone AR the areas of special flood hazard that result from the disaccreditation of the flood protection system. A community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if—

  * (1) the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor;

  * (2) a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the disaccredited system; and

  * (3) restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to occur within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.


* Communities that the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency determines to meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) as of January 1, 1992, shall not be subject to revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps that contravene the intent of this subsection. Such communities shall remain eligible for C zone rates for properties located in zone AR for any policy written prior to promulgation of final regulations for this section. Floodplain management criteria for such communities shall not require the elevation of improvements to existing structures and shall not exceed 3 feet above existing grade for new construction, provided the base flood elevation based on the disaccredited flood control system does not exceed five feet above existing grade, or the remaining new construction in such communities is limited to infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas.


* The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall develop and promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months after October 28, 1992.

#### (g) No extension of subsidy to new policies or lapsed policies
* The Administrator shall not provide flood insurance to prospective insureds at rates less than those estimated under subsection (a)(1), as required by paragraph (2) of that subsection, for—

  * (1) any policy under the flood insurance program that has lapsed in coverage,, unless the decision of the policy holder to permit a lapse in flood insurance coverage was as a result of the property covered by the policy no longer being required to retain such coverage; or

  * (2) any prospective insured who refuses to accept any offer for mitigation assistance by the Administrator (including an offer to relocate), including an offer of mitigation assistance—

    * (A) following a major disaster, as defined in section 5122 of this title; or

    * (B) in connection with—

      * (i) a repetitive loss property; or

      * (ii) a severe repetitive loss property.

#### (h) Definition
* In this section, the term "severe repetitive loss property" has the following meaning:

* #### (1) Single-family properties
  * In the case of a property consisting of 1 to 4 residences, such term means a property that—

    * (A) is covered under a contract for flood insurance made available under this chapter; and

    * (B) has incurred flood-related damage—

      * (i) for which 4 or more separate claims payments have been made under flood insurance coverage under this subchapter, with the amount of each such claim exceeding $5,000, and with the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeding $20,000; or

      * (ii) for which at least 2 separate claims payments have been made under such coverage, with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the value of the property.

* #### (2) Multifamily properties
  * In the case of a property consisting of 5 or more residences, such term shall have such meaning as the Director shall by regulation provide.

### §4015. Chargeable premium rates

  * (1) based on a consideration of the respective risks involved, including differences in risks due to land use measures, flood-proofing, flood forecasting, and similar measures;

  * (2) adequate, on the basis of accepted actuarial principles, to provide reserves for anticipated losses, or, if less than such amount, consistent with the objective of making flood insurance available where necessary at reasonable rates so as to encourage prospective insureds to purchase such insurance and with the purposes of this chapter;

  * (3) adequate, together with the fee under paragraph (1)(B)(iii) or (2) of section 4014(a) of this title, to provide for any administrative expenses of the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title);

  * (4) stated so as to reflect the basis for such rates, including the differences (if any) between the estimated risk premium rates under section 4014(a)(1) of this title and the estimated rates under section 4014(a)(2) of this title; and

  * (5) adequate, on the basis of accepted actuarial principles, to cover the average historical loss year obligations incurred by the National Flood Insurance Fund.

#### (c) Actuarial rate properties
* Subject only to the limitations provided under paragraphs (1) and (2), the chargeable rate shall not be less than the applicable estimated risk premium rate for such area (or subdivision thereof) under section 4014(a)(1) of this title with respect to the following properties:

  * Any property the construction or substantial improvement of which the Administrator determines has been started after December 31, 1974, or started after the effective date of the initial rate map published by the Administrator under paragraph (2) of section 4101 of this title for the area in which such property is located, whichever is later, except that the chargeable rate for properties under this paragraph shall be subject to the limitation under subsection (e).

* #### (2) Certain leased coastal and river properties
  * Any property leased from the Federal Government (including residential and nonresidential properties) that the Administrator determines is located on the river-facing side of any dike, levee, or other riverine flood control structure, or seaward of any seawall or other coastal flood control structure.

The Administrator shall deposit the sum in the National Flood Insurance Fund established under section 4017 of this title.

#### (e) Annual limitation on premium increases
* Except with respect to properties described under paragraph (2) of subsection (c), and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter—

        * (I) decreased the amount of the deductible; or

        * (II) increased the amount of coverage; or


      * (iii) was misrated;


  * (2) the chargeable risk premium rates for flood insurance under this chapter for any properties initially rated under section 4014(a)(2) of this title within any single risk classification, excluding properties for which the chargeable risk premium rate is not less than the applicable estimated risk premium rate under section 4014(a)(1) of this title, shall be increased by an amount that results in an average of such rate increases for properties within the risk classification during any 12-month period of not less than 5 percent of the average of the risk premium rates for such properties within the risk classification upon the commencement of such 12-month period;

  * (3) the chargeable risk premium rates for flood insurance under this chapter for any properties within any single risk classification may not be increased by an amount that would result in the average of such rate increases for properties within the risk classification during any 12-month period exceeding 15 percent of the average of the risk premium rates for properties within the risk classification upon the commencement of such 12-month period; and

  * (4) the chargeable risk premium rates for flood insurance under this chapter for any properties described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 4014(a)(2) of this title shall be increased by 25 percent each year, until the average risk premium rate for such properties is equal to the average of the risk premium rates for properties described under paragraph (3).

#### (f) Adjustment of premium
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Administrator determines that the holder of a flood insurance policy issued under this chapter is paying a lower premium than is required under this section due to an error in the flood plain determination, the Administrator may only prospectively charge the higher premium rate.

#### (g) Frequency of premium collection
* With respect to any chargeable premium rate prescribed under this section, the Administrator shall provide policyholders that are not required to escrow their premiums and fees for flood insurance as set forth under section 4012a of this title with the option of paying their premiums annually or monthly.

* Notwithstanding subsection (f), the premium rate for flood insurance under this chapter that is purchased on or after March 21, 2014—

  * (1) on a property located in an area not previously designated as having special flood hazards and that, pursuant to any issuance, revision, updating, or other change in a flood insurance map, becomes designated as such an area; and

  * (2) where such flood insurance premium rate is calculated under subsection (a)(1) of section 4014 of this title,


* shall for the first policy year be the preferred risk premium for the property and upon renewal shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (e) of this section until the rate reaches the rate calculated under subsection (a)(1) of section 4014 of this title.

#### (j) Premiums and reports
* In setting premium risk rates, in addition to striving to achieve the objectives of this chapter the Administrator shall also strive to minimize the number of policies with annual premiums that exceed one percent of the total coverage provided by the policy.
