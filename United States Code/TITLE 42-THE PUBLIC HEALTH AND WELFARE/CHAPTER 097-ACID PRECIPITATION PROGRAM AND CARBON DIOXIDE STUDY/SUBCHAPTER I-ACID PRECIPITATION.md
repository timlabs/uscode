### SUBCHAPTER I—ACID PRECIPITATION

### §8901. Introductory provisions
#### (a) Congressional statement of findings and purpose
* The Congress finds and declares that acid precipitation resulting from other than natural sources—

  * (1) could contribute to the increasing pollution of natural and man-made water systems;

  * (2) could adversely affect agricultural and forest crops;

  * (3) could adversely affect fish and wildlife and natural ecosystems generally;

  * (4) could contribute to corrosion of metals, wood, paint, and masonry used in construction and ornamentation of buildings and public monuments;

  * (5) could adversely affect public health and welfare; and

  * (6) could affect areas distant from sources and thus involve issues of national and international policy.

#### (b) Congressional declaration of purpose
* The Congress declares that it is the purpose of this subchapter—

  * (1) to identify the causes and sources of acid precipitation;

  * (2) to evaluate the environmental, social, and economic effects of acid precipitation; and

  * (3) based on the results of the research program established by this subchapter and to the extent consistent with existing law, to take action to the extent necessary and practicable (A) to limit or eliminate the identified emissions which are sources of acid precipitation, and (B) to remedy or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects which may result from acid precipitation.

#### (c) "Acid precipitation" defined
* For purposes of this subchapter the term "acid precipitation" means the wet or dry deposition from the atmosphere of acid chemical compounds.

### §8902. Comprehensive ten-year program
#### (a) Implementation by Acid Precipitation Task Force; membership, etc., of Task Force
* There is hereby established a comprehensive ten-year program to carry out the provisions of this subchapter; and to implement this program there shall be formed an Acid Precipitation Task Force (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the "Task Force"), of which the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall be joint chairmen. The remaining membership of the Task Force shall consist of—

  * (1) one representative each from the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of State, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Council on Environmental Quality, the National Science Foundation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority;

  * (2) the director of the Argonne National Laboratory, the director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; and

  * (3) four additional members to be appointed by the President.

#### (b) Research management consortium; membership, responsibilities, etc.
* The four National Laboratories (referred to in subsection (a)(2)) shall constitute a research management consortium having the responsibilities described in section 8903(b)(13) of this title as well as the general responsibilities required by their representation on the Task Force. In carrying out these responsibilities the consortium shall report to, and act pursuant to direction from, the joint chairmen of the Task Force.

#### (c) Director of research program
* The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall serve as the director of the research program established by this subchapter.

### §8903. Comprehensive research plan
#### (a) Preparation by Task Force for ten-year program; purposes
* The Task Force shall prepare a comprehensive research plan for the ten-year program (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the "comprehensive plan"), setting forth a coordinated program (1) to identify the causes and effects of acid precipitation and (2) to identify actions to limit or ameliorate the harmful effects of acid precipitation.

#### (b) Scope
* The comprehensive plan shall include programs for—

  * (1) identifying the sources of atmospheric emissions contributing to acid precipitation;

  * (2) establishing and operating a nationwide long-term monitoring network to detect and measure levels of acid precipitation;

  * (3) research in atmospheric physics and chemistry to facilitate understanding of the processes by which atmospheric emissions are transformed into acid precipitation;

  * (4) development and application of atmospheric transport models to enable prediction of long-range transport of substances causing acid precipitation;

  * (5) defining geographic areas of impact through deposition monitoring, identification of sensitive areas, and identification of areas at risk;

  * (6) broadening of impact data bases through collection of existing data on water and soil chemistry and through temporal trend analysis;

  * (7) development of dose-response functions with respect to soils, soil organisms, aquatic and amphibious organisms, crop plants, and forest plants;

  * (8) establishing and carrying out system studies with respect to plant physiology, aquatic ecosystems, soil chemistry systems, soil microbial systems, and forest ecosystems;

  * (9) economic assessments of (A) the environmental impacts caused by acid precipitation on crops, forests, fisheries, and recreational and aesthetic resources and structures, and (B) alternative technologies to remedy or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects which may result from acid precipitation;

  * (10) documenting all current Federal activities related to research on acid precipitation and ensuring that such activities are coordinated in ways that prevent needless duplication and waste of financial and technical resources;

  * (11) effecting cooperation in acid precipitation research and development programs, ongoing and planned, with the affected and contributing States and with other sovereign nations having a commonality of interest;

  * (12) subject to subsection (f)(1), management by the Task Force of financial resources committed to Federal acid precipitation research and development;

  * (13) subject to subsection (f)(2), management of the technical aspects of Federal acid precipitation research and development programs, including but not limited to (A) the planning and management of research and development programs and projects, (B) the selection of contractors and grantees to carry out such programs and projects, and (C) the establishment of peer review procedures to assure the quality of research and development programs and their products; and

  * (14) analyzing the information available regarding acid precipitation in order to formulate and present periodic recommendations to the Congress and the appropriate agencies about actions to be taken by these bodies to alleviate acid precipitation and its effects.

#### (c) Procedures applicable
* The comprehensive plan—

  * (1) shall be submitted in draft form to the Congress, and for public review, within six months after June 30, 1980;

  * (2) shall be available for public comment for a period of sixty days after its submission in draft form under paragraph (1);

  * (3) shall be submitted in final form, incorporating such needed revisions as arise from comments received during the review period, to the President and the Congress within forty-five days after the close of the period allowed for comments on the draft comprehensive plan under paragraph (2); and
