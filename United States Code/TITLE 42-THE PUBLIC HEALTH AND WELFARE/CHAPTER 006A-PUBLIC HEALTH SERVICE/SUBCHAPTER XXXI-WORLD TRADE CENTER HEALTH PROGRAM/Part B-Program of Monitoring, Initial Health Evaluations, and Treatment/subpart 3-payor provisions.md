### §300mm–41. Payment of claims
#### (a) In general
* Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), the cost of monitoring and treatment benefits and initial health evaluation benefits provided under subparts 1 and 2 of this part shall be paid for by the WTC Program from the World Trade Center Health Program Fund.

#### (b) Workers' compensation payment
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to paragraph (2), payment for treatment under subparts 1 and 2 of this part of a WTC-related health condition of an individual that is work-related shall be reduced or recouped to the extent that the WTC Program Administrator determines that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States, a State, or a locality, or other work-related injury or illness benefit plan of the employer of such individual, for such treatment. The provisions of clauses (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of paragraph (2)(B) of section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)] and paragraphs (3) and (4) of such section shall apply to the recoupment under this subsection of a payment to the WTC Program (with respect to a workers' compensation law or plan, or other work-related injury or illness plan of the employer involved, and such individual) in the same manner as such provisions apply to the reimbursement of a payment under section 1862(b)(2) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)] to the Secretary (with respect to such a law or plan and an individual entitled to benefits under title XVIII of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.]) except that any reference in such paragraph (4) to payment rates under title XVIII of the Social Security Act shall be deemed a reference to payment rates under this subchapter.

* #### (2) Exception
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply for any quarter, with respect to any workers' compensation law or plan, including line of duty compensation, to which New York City is obligated to make payments, if, in accordance with terms specified under the contract under subsection (d)(1)(A), New York City has made the full payment required under such contract for such quarter.

* #### (3) Rules of construction
  * Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect, modify, or relieve any obligations under a worker's compensation law or plan, other work-related injury or illness benefit plan of an employer, or any health insurance plan.

#### (c) Health insurance coverage
* #### (1) In general
  * In the case of an individual who has a WTC-related health condition that is not work-related and has health coverage for such condition through any public or private health plan (including health benefits under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.]) the provisions of section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)] shall apply to such a health plan and such individual in the same manner as they apply to group health plan and an individual entitled to benefits under title XVIII of such Act pursuant to section 226(a) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 426(a)]. Any costs for items and services covered under such plan that are not reimbursed by such health plan, due to the application of deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, other cost sharing, or otherwise, are reimbursable under this subchapter to the extent that they are covered under the WTC Program. The program under this subchapter shall not be treated as a legally liable party for purposes of applying section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)].

* #### (2) Recovery by individual providers
  * Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as requiring an entity providing monitoring and treatment under this subchapter to seek reimbursement under a health plan with which the entity has no contract for reimbursement.

* #### (3) Maintenance of required minimum essential coverage
  * No payment may be made for monitoring and treatment under this subchapter for an individual for a month (beginning with July 2014) if with respect to such month the individual—

    * (A) is an applicable individual (as defined in subsection (d) of section 5000A of title 26) for whom the exemption under subsection (e) of such section does not apply; and

    * (B) is not covered under minimum essential coverage, as required under subsection (a) of such section.

#### (d) Required contribution by New York City in program costs
* #### (1) Contract requirement
  * #### (A) In general
    * No funds may be disbursed from the World Trade Center Health Program Fund under section 300mm–61 of this title unless New York City has entered into a contract with the WTC Program Administrator under which New York City agrees, in a form and manner specified by the Administrator, to pay the full contribution described in subparagraph (B) in accordance with this subsection on a timely basis, plus any interest owed pursuant to subparagraph (E)(i). Such contract shall specify the terms under which New York City shall be considered to have made the full payment required for a quarter for purposes of subsection (b)(2).

  * #### (B) Full contribution amount
    * Under such contract, with respect to each calendar quarter of fiscal year 2016 and of each subsequent fiscal year through fiscal year 2090, the full contribution amount under this subparagraph shall be equal to 10 percent of the expenditures in carrying out this subchapter for the respective quarter.

      * (i) An amount derived from Federal sources.

      * (ii) An amount paid before January 2, 2011.

  * #### (E) Compliance
    * #### (i) Interest for late payment
      * If New York City fails to pay to the WTC Program Administrator pursuant to such contract the amount required for any calendar quarter by the day specified in subparagraph (D), interest shall accrue on the amount not so paid at the rate (determined by the Administrator) based on the average yield to maturity, plus 1 percentage point, on outstanding municipal bonds issued by New York City with a remaining maturity of at least 1 year.

    * #### (ii) Recovery of amounts owed
      * The amounts owed to the WTC Program Administrator under such contract shall be recoverable by the United States in an action in the same manner as payments made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] may be recoverable in an action brought under section 1862(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii)].

  * #### (F) Deposit in fund
    * The WTC Program Administer shall deposit amounts paid under such contract into the World Trade Center Health Program Fund under section 300mm–61 of this title.

    * (B) bill such amount directly to New York City; and

    * (C) certify periodically, for purposes of this subsection, whether or not New York City has paid the amount so billed.


* Such amount shall initially be estimated by the WTC Program Administrator and shall be subject to adjustment and reconciliation based upon actual expenditures in carrying out this subchapter.

* #### (3) Rule of construction

#### (e) Work-related described
* For the purposes of this section, a WTC-related health condition shall be treated as a condition that is work-related if—

  * (1) the condition is diagnosed in an enrolled WTC responder, or in an individual who qualifies as a certified-eligible WTC survivor on the basis of being a rescue, recovery, or cleanup worker; or

  * (2) with respect to the condition the individual has filed and had established a claim under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States or a State, or other work-related injury or illness benefit plan of the employer of such individual.
