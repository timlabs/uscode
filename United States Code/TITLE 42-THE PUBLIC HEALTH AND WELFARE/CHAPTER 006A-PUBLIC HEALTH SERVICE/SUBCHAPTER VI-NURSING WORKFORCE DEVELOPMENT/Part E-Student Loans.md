#### (c) Regulatory standards applicable to collection of loans
* (1) Any standard established by the Secretary by regulation for the collection by schools of nursing of loans made pursuant to loan agreements under this part shall provide that the failure of any such school to collect such loans shall be measured in accordance with this subsection. With respect to the student loan fund established pursuant to such agreements, this subsection may not be construed to require such schools to reimburse such loan fund for loans that became uncollectable prior to 1983.

* (2) The measurement of a school's failure to collect loans made under this part shall be the ratio (stated as a percentage) that the defaulted principal amount outstanding of such school bears to the matured loans of such school.

* (3) For purposes of this subsection—

  * (A) the term "default" means the failure of a borrower of a loan made under this part to—

    * (i) make an installment payment when due; or

    * (ii) comply with any other term of the promissory note for such loan,


* except that a loan made under this part shall not be considered to be in default if the loan is discharged in bankruptcy or if the school reasonably concludes from written contacts with the borrower that the borrower intends to repay the loan;

  * (B) the term "defaulted principal amount outstanding" means the total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or cancelled) on loans—

    * (i) repayable monthly and in default for at least 120 days; and

    * (ii) repayable less frequently than monthly and in default for at least 180 days;


  * (C) the term "grace period" means the period of nine months beginning on the date on which the borrower ceases to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at a school of nursing; and

  * (D) the term "matured loans" means the total principal amount of all loans made by a school of nursing under this part minus the total principal amount of loans made by such school to students who are—

    * (i) enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at such school; or

The aggregate of the loans for all years from such funds may not exceed $17,000 in the case of any student during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. After fiscal year 2011, such amounts shall be adjusted to provide for a cost-of-attendance increase for the yearly loan rate and the aggregate of the loans. In the granting of such loans, a school shall give preference to licensed practical nurses, to persons with exceptional financial need, and to persons who enter as first-year students after enactment of this subchapter.

#### (b) Terms and conditions
* Loans from any such student loan fund by any school shall be made on such terms and conditions as the school may determine; subject, however, to such conditions, limitations, and requirements as the Secretary may prescribe (by regulation or in the agreement with the school) with a view to preventing impairment of the capital of such fund to the maximum extent practicable in the light of the objective of enabling the student to complete his course of study; and except that—

  * (1) such a loan may be made only to a student who (A) is in need of the amount of the loan to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at the school leading to a baccalaureate or associate degree in nursing or an equivalent degree, or a diploma in nursing, or a graduate degree in nursing, (B) is capable, in the opinion of the school, of maintaining good standing in such course of study, and (C) with respect to any student enrolling in the school after June 30, 2000, is of financial need (as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary);;

  * (3) in the case of a student who received such a loan before September 29, 1995, an amount up to 85 per centum of any such loan made before such date (plus interest thereon) shall be canceled for full-time employment as a professional nurse (including teaching in any of the fields of nurse training and service as an administrator, supervisor, or consultant in any of the fields of nursing) in any public or nonprofit private agency, institution, or organization (including neighborhood health centers), at the rate of 15 per centum of the amount of such loan (plus interest) unpaid on the first day of such service for each of the first, second, and third complete year of such service, and 20 per centum of such amount (plus interest) for each complete fourth and fifth year of such service;

  * (4) the liability to repay the unpaid balance of such loan and accrued interest thereon shall be canceled upon the death of the borrower, or if the Secretary determines that he has become permanently and totally disabled;

  * (5) such a loan shall bear interest on the unpaid balance of the loan, computed only for periods during which the loan is repayable, at the rate of 5 percent per annum;

  * (6) such a loan shall be made without security or endorsement, except that if the borrower is a minor and the note or other evidence of obligation executed by him would not, under the applicable law, create a binding obligation, either security or endorsement may be required;

  * (7) no note or other evidence of any such loan may be transferred or assigned by the school making the loan except that, if the borrower transfers to another school participating in the program under this part such note or other evidence of a loan may be transferred to such other school; and

  * (8) pursuant to uniform criteria established by the Secretary, the repayment period established under paragraph (2) for any student borrower who during the repayment period failed to make consecutive payments and who, during the last 12 months of the repayment period, has made at least 12 consecutive payments may be extended for a period not to exceed 10 years.

No such charge may be made if the payment of such installment or the filing of such evidence is made within 60 days after the date on which such installment or filing is due. The amount of any such charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount of such installment. The school may elect to add the amount of any such charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the first day after the day on which such installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school not later than the due date of the next installment after receipt by the borrower of notice of the assessment of the charge.

* The Secretary is authorized to attempt to collect any loan which was made under this part, which is in default, and which was referred to the Secretary by a school of nursing with which the Secretary has an agreement under this part, on behalf of that school under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe (including reimbursement from the school's student loan fund for expenses the Secretary may reasonably incur in attempting collection), but only if the school has complied with such requirements as the Secretary may specify by regulation with respect to the collection of loans under this part. A loan so referred shall be treated as a debt subject to section 5514 of title 5. Amounts collected shall be deposited in the school's student loan fund.
