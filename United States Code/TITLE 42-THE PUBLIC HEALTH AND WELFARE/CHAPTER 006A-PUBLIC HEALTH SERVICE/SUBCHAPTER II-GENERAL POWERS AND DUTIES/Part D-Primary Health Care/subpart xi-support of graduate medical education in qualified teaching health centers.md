    * (C) establishment of new approved graduate medical residency training programs.

* #### (2) Per resident amount
  * In making payments under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider the cost of training residents at teaching health centers and the implications of the per resident amount on approved graduate medical residency training programs at teaching health centers.

* #### (3) Priority
  * In making payments under paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall give priority to qualified teaching health centers that—

    * (A) serve a health professional shortage area with a designation in effect under section 254e of this title or a medically underserved community (as defined in section 295p of this title); or

    * (B) are located in a rural area (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title).

#### (b) Amount of payments
* #### (1) In general
  * Subject to paragraph (2), the amounts payable under this section to qualified teaching health centers for an approved graduate medical residency training program for a fiscal year are each of the following amounts:

  * #### (A) Direct expense amount
    * The amount determined under subsection (c) for direct expenses associated with sponsoring approved graduate medical residency training programs.

  * #### (B) Indirect expense amount
    * The amount determined under subsection (d) for indirect expenses associated with the additional costs relating to teaching residents in such programs.

* #### (2) Capped amount
  * #### (A) In general

  * #### (B) Limitation
    * The Secretary shall limit the funding of full-time equivalent residents in order to ensure the direct and indirect payments as determined under subsection (c) and (d) do not exceed the total amount of funds appropriated in a fiscal year under subsection (g).

#### (c) Amount of payment for direct graduate medical education
* #### (1) In general
  * The amount determined under this subsection for payments to qualified teaching health centers for direct graduate expenses relating to approved graduate medical residency training programs for a fiscal year is equal to the product of—

    * (A) the updated national per resident amount for direct graduate medical education, as determined under paragraph (2); and

    * (B) the average number of full-time equivalent residents in the teaching health center's graduate approved medical residency training programs as determined under section 1395ww(h)(4) of this title (without regard to the limitation under subparagraph (F) of such section) during the fiscal year.

* #### (2) Updated national per resident amount for direct graduate medical education
  * The updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education for a qualified teaching health center for a fiscal year is an amount determined as follows:

  * #### (A) Determination of qualified teaching health center per resident amount
    * The Secretary shall compute for each individual qualified teaching health center a per resident amount—

      * (i) by dividing the national average per resident amount computed under section 256e(c)(2)(D) of this title into a wage-related portion and a non-wage related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);

      * (ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title (but without application of section 4410 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1395ww note)) during the preceding fiscal year for the teaching health center's area; and

      * (iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).

  * #### (B) Updating rate
    * The Secretary shall update such per resident amount for each such qualified teaching health center as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

#### (d) Amount of payment for indirect medical education
* #### (1) In general
  * The amount determined under this subsection for payments to qualified teaching health centers for indirect expenses associated with the additional costs of teaching residents for a fiscal year is equal to an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary.

* #### (2) Factors
  * In determining the amount under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

    * (A) evaluate indirect training costs relative to supporting a primary care residency program in qualified teaching health centers; and

    * (B) based on this evaluation, assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect expenses under this section and the payments for direct graduate medical education as determined under subsection (c) in a fiscal year do not exceed the amount appropriated for such expenses as determined in subsection (g).

* #### (3) Interim payment
  * Before the Secretary makes a payment under this subsection pursuant to a determination of indirect expenses under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide to qualified teaching health centers a payment, in addition to any payment made under subsection (c), for expected indirect expenses associated with the additional costs of teaching residents for a fiscal year, based on an estimate by the Secretary.

#### (e) Clarification regarding relationship to other payments for graduate medical education
* Payments under this section—

  * (1) shall be in addition to any payments—

    * (A) for the indirect costs of medical education under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title;

    * (B) for direct graduate medical education costs under section 1395ww(h) of this title; and

    * (C) for direct costs of medical education under section 1395ww(k) of this title;


  * (2) shall not be taken into account in applying the limitation on the number of total full-time equivalent residents under subparagraphs (F) and (G) of section 1395ww(h)(4) of this title and clauses (v), (vi)(I), and (vi)(II) of section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title for the portion of time that a resident rotates to a hospital; and

  * (3) shall not include the time in which a resident is counted toward full-time equivalency by a hospital under paragraph (2) or under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B)(iv) of this title, section 1395ww(h)(4)(E) of this title, or section 256e of this title.

#### (f) Reconciliation
* The Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a teaching health center in the application of the teaching health center for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the teaching health center for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made to pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395oo of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d) of this title is subject to review under such section.

#### (g) Funding
