#### (b) Certificate requirement
* #### (1) Certificate
  * No facility may conduct an examination or procedure described in paragraph (2) involving mammography after October 1, 1994, unless the facility obtains—

    * (A) a certificate or a temporary renewal certificate—

      * (i) that is issued, and, if applicable, renewed, by the Secretary in accordance with paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection (c);

    * (A) The facility has submitted the required materials to the accreditation body within the established time frames for the submission of such materials but the accreditation body is unable to complete the reaccreditation process before the certification expires.

    * (B) The facility has acquired additional or replacement equipment, or has had significant personnel changes or other unforeseen situations that have caused the facility to be unable to meet reaccreditation timeframes, but in the opinion of the accreditation body have not compromised the quality of mammography.

* #### (3) Limited provisional certificate
  * The Secretary may, upon the request of an accreditation body, issue a limited provisional certificate to an entity to enable the entity to conduct examinations for educational purposes while an onsite visit from an accreditation body is in progress.
