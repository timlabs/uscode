### PART A—WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME PERSONS

### §6861. Congressional findings and purpose
* (a) The Congress finds that—

  * (1) a fast, cost-effective, and environmentally sound way to prevent future energy shortages in the United States while reducing the Nation's dependence on imported energy supplies, is to encourage and facilitate, through major programs, the implementation of energy conservation and renewable-resource energy measures with respect to dwelling units;

  * (2) existing efforts to encourage and facilitate such measures are inadequate because—

    * (A) many dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons are energy inefficient;

    * (B) low-income persons can least afford to make the modifications necessary to provide for efficient energy equipment in such dwellings and otherwise to improve the energy efficiency of such dwellings;


  * (3) weatherization of such dwellings would lower shelter costs in dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons as well as save energy and reduce future energy capacity requirements; and

  * (4) States, through Community Action Agencies established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] and units of general purpose local government, should be encouraged, with Federal financial and technical assistance, to develop and support coordinated weatherization programs designed to alleviate the adverse effects of energy costs on such low-income persons, to supplement other Federal programs serving such low-income persons, and to increase energy efficiency.


* (b) It is, therefore, the purpose of this part to develop and implement a weatherization assistance program to increase the energy efficiency of dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons, reduce their total residential energy expenditures, and improve their health and safety, especially low-income persons who are particularly vulnerable such as the elderly, the handicapped, and children.

The Secretary shall take into consideration comments submitted regarding such proposed amendment and shall promulgate and publish final amended regulations not later than 120 days after November 9, 1978.

* (4) The Secretary may amend the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) to provide that the standards described in paragraph (2)(A) take into consideration improvements in the health and safety of occupants of dwelling units, and other non-energy benefits, from weatherization.

* (5) In carrying out paragraphs (2)(A) and (3), the Secretary shall establish the standards and procedures described in such paragraphs so that weatherization efforts being carried out under this part and under programs described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) will accomplish uniform results among the States in any area with a similar climatic condition.

* (6) In any case in which a dwelling consists of a rental unit or rental units, the State, in the implementation of this part, shall ensure that—

  * (A) the benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with such rental units, including units where the tenants pay for their energy through their rent, will accrue primarily to the low-income tenants residing in such units;

  * (B) for a reasonable period of time after weatherization work has been completed on a dwelling containing a unit occupied by an eligible household, the tenants in that unit (including households paying for their energy through their rent) will not be subjected to rent increases unless those increases are demonstrably related to matters other than the weatherization work performed;

  * (C) the enforcement of subparagraph (B) is provided through procedures established by the State by which tenants may file complaints and owners, in response to such complaints, shall demonstrate that the rent increase concerned is related to matters other than the weatherization work performed; and

  * (D) no undue or excessive enhancement will occur to the value of such dwelling units.


* (7) As a condition of having assistance provided under this part with respect to multifamily buildings, a State may require financial participation from the owners of such buildings.

  * #### (B) Restrictions
    * Subparagraph (A) shall apply only if—

      * (i) the tribal organization serving the low-income members of the applicable Indian tribe requests that the Secretary make a grant directly; and
