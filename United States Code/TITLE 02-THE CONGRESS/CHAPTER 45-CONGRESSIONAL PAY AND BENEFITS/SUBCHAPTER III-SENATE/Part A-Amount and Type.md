  * (B) in the case of such personnel appointed to positions for which the rates of pay for the particular positions were fixed by or pursuant to law at specific rates on the day before the effective date of the amendments made by section 212 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2020, adjust such rates; and

  * (C) in the case of such personnel appointed to positions for which the maximum rates of pay for the particular positions were fixed by or pursuant to law on the day before such effective date, adjust such maximum rates; and

  * (2) adjust any limitation or allowance applicable to such personnel;


* by percentages which are equal or equivalent, insofar as practicable, to the percentages of the adjustments made by the President under such section 5303 (and, as the case may be, section 5304 or 5304a of such title, as applied to employees employed in the pay locality of the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, Maryland consolidated metropolitan statistical area) for corresponding rates of pay for employees subject to the General Schedule contained in section 5332 of such title and adjust the rates of such personnel by such amounts as necessary to maintain the pay relationships that existed on the effective date of the amendments made by section 212 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2020 between the maximum rate of pay for Senate personnel and Senators. Such rates, limitations, and allowances adjusted by the President pro tempore shall become effective on the first day of the month in which any adjustment becomes effective under such section 5303 or section 3(c) of this Act.

* (b) The adjustments made by the President pro tempore shall be made in such manner as he considers advisable and shall have the force and effect of law.

* (e) Any percentage used in any statute specifically providing for an adjustment in rates of pay in lieu of an adjustment made under section 5303 of title 5 and, as the case may be, section 5304 or 5304a of such title for any calendar year shall be treated as the percentage used in an adjustment made under such section 5303, 5304, or 5304a, as applicable, for purposes of subsection (a).

* (f) For purposes of this section, the term "personnel" does not include any Senator.

### §4572. Rates of compensation paid by Secretary of Senate; applicability of Senate pay adjustments by President pro tempore of Senate
* No provision of this Act or of any Act enacted after October 1, 1976, which specifies a rate of compensation (including a maximum rate) for any position or employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate shall, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, be construed to affect the applicability of section 4571 of this title to such rate.

### §4573. Senate pay adjustments; action by President pro tempore of Senate
* (a) Whenever, after November 5, 1990, there is an adjustment in rates of pay for Senators (other than an adjustment which occurs by virtue of an adjustment under section 5303 of title 5 in rates of pay under the General Schedule), the President pro tempore of the Senate may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, rule, or regulation, adjust the rate of pay (and any minimum or maximum rate, limitation, or allowance) applicable to personnel whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate (including such personnel appointed to positions for which the specific amount of the rate of pay for the particular position is fixed by statute on the day before the effective date of the amendments made by section 212 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2020 and such personnel appointed to positions for which the maximum rates of pay for the particular positions were fixed by or pursuant to law on the day before such effective date) to the extent necessary to maintain the pay relationships that existed on such effective date between the maximum rate of pay for Senate personnel and Senators.

* (b) Adjustments made by the President pro tempore under this section shall be made in such manner as he considers advisable and shall have the force and effect of law.

### §4574. Limit on rate of compensation of Senate officers and employees
* No officer or employee of the Senate shall receive pay for any services performed by him at any rate higher than that provided for the office or employment to which he has been regularly appointed.

### §4575. Gross rate of compensation of employees paid by Secretary of Senate
#### (a) Annual rate; certification
* (1) Whenever the rate of compensation of any employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate is fixed or adjusted on or after October 1, 1980, such rate as so fixed or adjusted shall be at a single whole dollar per annum gross rate and may not include a fractional part of a dollar.

* (2) New or changed rates of compensation (other than changes in rates which are made by law) of any such employee (other than an employee who is an elected officer of the Senate) shall be certified in writing to the Disbursing Office of the Senate (and, for purposes of this paragraph, a new rate of compensation refers to compensation in the case of an appointment, transfer from one Senate appointing authority to another, or promotion by an appointing authority to a position the compensation for which is fixed by law). In the case of an appointment or other new rate of compensation, the certification must be received by such office on or before the day the rate of new compensation is to become effective. In any other case, the changed rate of compensation shall take effect on the first day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received within the first ten days of such month), on the first day of the month after the month in which such certification is received (if the day on which such certification is received is after the twenty-fifth day of the month in which it is received), and on the sixteenth day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received after the tenth day and before the twenty-sixth day of such month). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the certification for a changed rate of compensation for an employee specifies an effective date of such change, such change shall become effective on the date so specified, but only if the date so specified is the first or sixteenth day of a month and is after the effective date prescribed in the preceding sentence; and, notwithstanding such sentence and the preceding provisions of this sentence, any changed rate of compensation for a new employee or an employee transferred from one appointing authority to another shall take effect on the date of such employee's appointment or transfer (as the case may be) if such date is later than the effective date for such changed rate of compensation as prescribed by such sentence.

#### (b) Conversion; increase in compensation
* The rate of compensation of each employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate which was fixed before August 1, 1967, at a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is payable by law shall be converted as of such date to the lowest per annum gross rate which is a multiple of $180 and which is not less than the aggregate rate of compensation (basic compensation plus additional compensation provided by law) which such employee was receiving immediately prior to such date. Any increments of longevity compensation to which an employee became entitled prior to August 1, 1967, under section 4507(b) of this title shall be excluded in converting such employee's rate of compensation under this subsection, but such employee's rate of gross compensation shall be increased by $540 (which shall be considered to be an increase under section 4507(b) of this title) for each such increment.

#### (c) Reference in other provisions to basic rates and additional compensation as reference to per annum gross rate
* In any case in which the rate of compensation of any employee or position, or class of employees or positions, the compensation for which is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, or any maximum or minimum rate with respect to any such employee, position, or class, is referred to in or provided by statute or Senate resolution, and the rate so referred to or provided is a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is provided by law, such statutory provision or resolution shall be deemed to refer, in lieu of such basic rate, to the per annum gross rate which an employee receiving such basic rate immediately prior to August 1, 1967, would receive (without regard to such statutory provision or resolution) under subsection (b) on and after such date.
