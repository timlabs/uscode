* (4) Failure of contestant to claim right to contestee's seat.

#### (c) Motion for more definite statement

The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the committee is not obeyed within ten days after notice of the order or within such other time as the committee may fix, the committee may dismiss the action, or make such order as it deems just.

#### (d) Time for serving answer after service of motion

Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of such service.

### §385. Default of contestee
* The failure of contestee to answer the notice of contest or to otherwise defend as provided by this chapter shall not be deemed an admission of the truth of the averments in the notice of contest. Notwithstanding such failure, the burden is upon contestant to prove that the election results entitle him to contestee's seat.

### §386. Deposition
#### (a) Oral examination
* Either party may take the testimony of any person, including the opposing party, by deposition upon oral examination for the purpose of discovery or for use as evidence in the contested election case, or for both purposes.
