An act by an individual that causes a railroad carrier to be in violation is a violation. For a violation of section 21106 of this title, a separate violation occurs for each day a facility is not in compliance.

* (2) The Secretary of Transportation imposes a civil penalty under this subsection. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $25,000.

If the action is against an individual, the action also may be brought in the judicial district in which the individual resides.

* (2) A civil action under this subsection must be brought not later than 2 years after the date of the violation unless administrative notification under section 3711 of title 31 is given within that 2-year period to the person committing the violation. However, even if notification is given, the action must be brought within the period specified in section 2462 of title 28.

* (c) IMPUTATION OF KNOWLEDGE.—In any proceeding under this section, a railroad carrier is deemed to know the acts of its officers and agents.

### §21304. Willfulness requirement for penalties against individuals
