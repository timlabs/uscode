### **CHAPTER 327—ODOMETERS**

### §32701. Findings and purposes
* (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—

  * (1) buyers of motor vehicles rely heavily on the odometer reading as an index of the condition and value of a vehicle;

  * (2) buyers are entitled to rely on the odometer reading as an accurate indication of the mileage of the vehicle;

  * (3) an accurate indication of the mileage assists a buyer in deciding on the safety and reliability of the vehicle; and

  * (4) motor vehicles move in, or affect, interstate and foreign commerce.


* (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this chapter are—

  * (1) to prohibit tampering with motor vehicle odometers; and

  * (2) to provide safeguards to protect purchasers in the sale of motor vehicles with altered or reset odometers.

  * (3) "distributor" means a person that sold at least 5 motor vehicles during the prior 12 months for resale.

  * (4) "leased motor vehicle" means a motor vehicle leased to a person for at least 4 months by a lessor that leased at least 5 vehicles during the prior 12 months.

  * (5) "odometer" means an instrument or system of components for measuring and recording the distance a motor vehicle is driven, but does not include an auxiliary instrument or system of components designed to be reset by the operator of the vehicle to record mileage of a trip.

  * (6) "repair" and "replace" mean to restore to a sound working condition by replacing any part of an odometer or by correcting any inoperative part of an odometer.

### §32703. Preventing tampering
* A person may not—

  * (1) advertise for sale, sell, use, install, or have installed, a device that makes an odometer of a motor vehicle register a mileage different from the mileage the vehicle was driven, as registered by the odometer within the designed tolerance of the manufacturer of the odometer;

  * (2) disconnect, reset, alter, or have disconnected, reset, or altered, an odometer of a motor vehicle intending to change the mileage registered by the odometer;

  * (3) with intent to defraud, operate a motor vehicle on a street, road, or highway if the person knows that the odometer of the vehicle is disconnected or not operating; or

  * (4) conspire to violate this section or section 32704 or 32705 of this title.

### §32704. Service, repair, and replacement
* (a) ADJUSTING MILEAGE.—A person may service, repair, or replace an odometer of a motor vehicle if the mileage registered by the odometer remains the same as before the service, repair, or replacement. If the mileage cannot remain the same—

  * (1) the person shall adjust the odometer to read zero; and

  * (2) the owner of the vehicle or agent of the owner shall attach a written notice to the left door frame of the vehicle specifying the mileage before the service, repair, or replacement and the date of the service, repair, or replacement.


* (b) REMOVING OR ALTERING NOTICE.—A person may not, with intent to defraud, remove or alter a notice attached to a motor vehicle as required by this section.

### §32705. Disclosure requirements on transfer of motor vehicles
* (a)(1) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.—Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation that include the way in which information is disclosed and retained under this section, a person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle shall give the transferee the following written disclosure:

  * (A) Disclosure of the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer.

  * (B) Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the transferor knows that the odometer reading is different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.


* (2) A person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle may not violate a regulation prescribed under this section or give a false statement to the transferee in making the disclosure required by such a regulation.

* (3) A person acquiring a motor vehicle for resale may not accept a written disclosure under this section unless it is complete.

* (4)(A) This subsection shall apply to all transfers of motor vehicles (unless otherwise exempted by the Secretary by regulation), except in the case of transfers of new motor vehicles from a vehicle manufacturer jointly to a dealer and a person engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles for a period of 30 days or less.

* (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "new motor vehicle" means any motor vehicle driven with no more than the limited use necessary in moving, transporting, or road testing such vehicle prior to delivery from the vehicle manufacturer to a dealer, but in no event shall the odometer reading of such vehicle exceed 300 miles.

* (5) The Secretary may exempt such classes or categories of vehicles as the Secretary deems appropriate from these requirements. Until such time as the Secretary amends or modifies the regulations set forth in 49 CFR 580.6, such regulations shall have full force and effect.

* (b) MILEAGE STATEMENT REQUIREMENT FOR LICENSING.—(1) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the transferee, in submitting an application to a State for the title on which the license will be issued, includes with the application the transferor's title and, if that title contains the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection, a statement, signed and dated by the transferor, of the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle that has not been licensed before the transfer.

* (2)(A) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the title to a motor vehicle issued to a transferor by a State is in the possession of a lienholder when the transferor transfers ownership of the vehicle, the transferor may use a written power of attorney (if allowed by State law) in making the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. Regulations prescribed under this paragraph—

  * (i) shall prescribe the form of the power of attorney;

  * (ii) shall provide that the form be printed by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);

  * (iii) shall provide that the State issue the form to the transferee;

  * (iv) shall provide that the person exercising the power of attorney retain a copy and submit the original to the State with a copy of the title showing the restatement of the mileage;

  * (v) may require that the State retain the power of attorney and the copy of the title for an appropriate period or that the State adopt alternative measures consistent with section 32701(b) of this title, after considering the costs to the State;

  * (vi) shall ensure that the mileage at the time of transfer be disclosed on the power of attorney document;

  * (vii) shall ensure that the mileage be restated exactly by the person exercising the power of attorney in the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection;

  * (viii) may not require that a motor vehicle be titled in the State in which the power of attorney was issued;

  * (ix) shall consider the need to facilitate normal commercial transactions in the sale or exchange of motor vehicles; and

  * (x) shall provide other conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.


* (B) Section 32709(a) and (b) applies to a person granting or granted a power of attorney under this paragraph.

  * (i) is produced by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);

  * (ii) indicates the mileage disclosure required to be made under subsection (a) of this section; and

  * (iii) contains a space for the transferee to disclose the mileage at the time of a future transfer and to sign and date the disclosure.

* (c) LEASED MOTOR VEHICLES.—(1) For a leased motor vehicle, the regulations prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall require written disclosure about mileage to be made by the lessee to the lessor when the lessor transfers ownership of that vehicle.

* (2) Under those regulations, the lessor shall provide written notice to the lessee of—

  * (A) the lessee's mileage disclosure requirements under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and

  * (B) the penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.


* (3) The lessor shall retain the disclosures made by a lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection for at least 4 years following the date the lessor transfers the leased motor vehicle.

* (4) If the lessor transfers ownership of a leased motor vehicle without obtaining possession of the vehicle, the lessor, in making the disclosure required by subsection (a) of this section, may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.

* (d) STATE ALTERNATE VEHICLE MILEAGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.—The requirements of subsections (b) and (c)(1) of this section on the disclosure of motor vehicle mileage when motor vehicles are transferred or leased apply in a State unless the State has in effect alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall approve alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements submitted by a State unless the Secretary decides that the requirements are not consistent with the purpose of the disclosure required by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be.

* (e) AUCTION SALES.—If a motor vehicle is sold at an auction, the auction company conducting the auction shall maintain the following records for at least 4 years after the date of the sale:

  * (2) the vehicle identification number required under chapter 301 or 331 of this title.

  * (3) the odometer reading on the date the auction company took possession of the motor vehicle.

* (2) If a State requests, the Secretary shall assist the State in revising its laws to comply with subsection (b) of this section. If a State requires time beyond April 28, 1989, to revise its laws to achieve compliance, the Secretary, on request of the State, may grant additional time that the Secretary considers reasonable by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. The notice shall include the reasons for granting the additional time. In granting additional time, the Secretary shall ensure that the State is making reasonable efforts to achieve compliance.

* (g) ELECTRONIC DISCLOSURES.—

  * (1) Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the Motor Vehicle and Highway Safety Improvement Act of 2012, in carrying out this section, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations permitting any written disclosures or notices and related matters to be provided electronically.

  * (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) and subject to paragraph (3), a State, without approval from the Secretary under subsection (d), may allow for written disclosures or notices and related matters to be provided electronically if—

    * (A) in compliance with—

      * (i) the requirements of subchapter 1 of chapter 96 of title 15; or

      * (ii) the requirements of a State law under section 7002(a) of title 15; and


    * (B) the disclosures or notices otherwise meet the requirements under this section, including appropriate authentication and security measures.
