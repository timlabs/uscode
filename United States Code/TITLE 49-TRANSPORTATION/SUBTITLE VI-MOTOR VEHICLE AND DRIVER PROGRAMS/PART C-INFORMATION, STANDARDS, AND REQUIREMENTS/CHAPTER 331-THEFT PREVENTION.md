* (b) EXTENSION OF APPLICATION.—(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)—

  * (A) not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines; and

  * (B) not covered by the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section.


* (2) The Secretary shall include as part of the regulatory proceeding under this subsection the finding of, and the record developed by, the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section.

* (c) INITIAL REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS.—Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall make a finding that the Secretary shall apply the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section unless the Attorney General finds, based on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.

* (d) LONG RANGE REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS.—(1) Not later than December 31, 1999, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:

  * (A) whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.

  * (B) whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under section 33106 of this title are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.


* (2)(A) In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall—

  * (i) consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;

  * (ii) base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title;

  * (iii) consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under section 33115(b) of this title and section 2322 of title 18 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;

  * (iv) base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under section 33113 of this title; and

  * (v) base that finding on other information the Attorney General develops and includes in the public record.


* (B) The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.

* (3) In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under section 33106 of this title for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before October 25, 1992, or at the level provided in section 33106(b)(2)(C) of this title for model year 2000.

* (e) EFFECTIVE DATE OF STANDARD.—A standard prescribed under this section takes effect at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed, except that the Secretary may prescribe an earlier effective date if the Secretary—

  * (1) decides with good cause that the earlier date is in the public interest; and

  * (2) publishes the reasons for the decision.


* (f) NOTIFICATION OF CONGRESS.—The Secretary and the Attorney General shall inform the appropriate legislative committees of Congress with jurisdiction over this part and section 2322 of title 18 of actions taken or planned under this section.

### §33104. Designation of high theft vehicle lines and parts
* (a) DESIGNATION, NONAPPLICATION, SELECTION, AND PROCEDURES.—(1) For purposes of the standard under section 33102 of this title, the following are high theft lines:

  * (A) a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.

  * (B) a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after December 31, 1989, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.

  * (C) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.


* (2) The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.

* (3) The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.

* (4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.

* (5) A manufacturer may not be required to comply with the standard under a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection for a model year beginning earlier than 6 months after the date of the selection.

* (6) A passenger motor vehicle line subject on October 25, 1992, to parts marking requirements under sections 602 and 603 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92–513, 86 Stat. 947), as added by section 101(a) of the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98–547, 98 Stat. 2756), continues to be subject to the requirements of this section and section 33102 of this title unless the line is exempted under section 33106 of this title.

* (b) DETERMINING THEFT RATE FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES.—(1) In this subsection, "new passenger motor vehicle thefts", when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.

* (2) Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction—

  * (A) the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and

  * (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.


* (3) Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.

* (4) In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.

* (5) The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.

* (c) PROVIDING INFORMATION.—The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.

* (d) APPLICATION.—Except as provided in section 33106 of this title, the Secretary may not make the standard inapplicable to a line that has been subject to the standard.

### §33105. Cost limitations
* (a) MAXIMUM MANUFACTURER COSTS.—A standard under section 33102 or 33103 of this title may not impose—

  * (1) on a manufacturer of motor vehicles, compliance costs of more than $15 a motor vehicle; or

  * (2) on a manufacturer of major replacement parts, compliance costs for each part of more than the reasonable amount (but less than $15) that the Secretary of Transportation specifies in the standard.


* (b) COSTS INVOLVED IN ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS.—For a manufacturer engaged in identifying engines or transmissions on October 25, 1984, in a way that substantially complies with the standard—

  * (1) the costs of identifying engines and transmissions may not be considered in calculating the manufacturer's costs under subsection (a) of this section; and

  * (2) the manufacturer may not be required under the standard to conform to any identification system for engines and transmissions that imposes greater costs on the manufacturer than are incurred under the identification system used by the manufacturer on October 25, 1984.


* (c) COST ADJUSTMENTS.—(1) In this subsection—

  * (A) "base period" means calendar year 1984.

  * (B) "price index" means the average over a calendar year of the Consumer Price Index (all items—United States city average) published monthly by the Secretary of Labor.


* (2) At the beginning of each calendar year, as necessary data become available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Secretary of Labor shall certify to the Secretary of Transportation and publish in the Federal Register the percentage difference between the price index for the 12 months before the beginning of the calendar year and the price index for the base period. For model years beginning in that calendar year, the amounts specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be adjusted by the percentage difference.
