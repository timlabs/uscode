### **CHAPTER 325—BUMPER STANDARDS**

### §32501. Purpose
* The purpose of this chapter is to reduce economic loss resulting from damage to passenger motor vehicles involved in motor vehicle accidents by providing for the maintenance and enforcement of bumper standards.

### §32502. Bumper standards
* (a) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND NONAPPLICATION.—The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation bumper standards for passenger motor vehicles and may prescribe by regulation bumper standards for passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured in, or imported into, the United States. A standard does not apply to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment—

  * (1) intended only for export;

  * (2) labeled for export on the vehicle or equipment and the outside of any container of the vehicle or equipment; and

  * (3) exported.


* (b) LIMITATIONS.—A standard under this section—

  * (1) may not conflict with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under chapter 301 of this title;

  * (2) may not specify a dollar amount for the cost of repairing damage to a passenger motor vehicle; and

  * (3) to the greatest practicable extent, may not preclude the attachment of a detachable hitch.


* (c) EXEMPTIONS.—For good cause, the Secretary may exempt from all or any part of a standard—

  * (1) a multipurpose passenger vehicle;

  * (2) a make, model, or class of a passenger motor vehicle manufactured for a special use, if the standard would interfere unreasonably with the special use of the vehicle; or

  * (3) a passenger motor vehicle for which an application for an exemption under section 30013(b) of this title has been filed in accordance with the requirements of that section.


* (d) COST REDUCTION AND CONSIDERATIONS.—When prescribing a standard under this section, the Secretary shall design the standard to obtain the maximum feasible reduction of costs to the public, considering—

  * (1) the costs and benefits of carrying out the standard;

  * (2) the effect of the standard on insurance costs and legal fees and costs;

  * (3) savings in consumer time and inconvenience; and

  * (4) health and safety, including emission standards.


* (e) PROCEDURES.—Section 553 of title 5 applies to a standard prescribed under this section. However, the Secretary shall give an interested person an opportunity to make oral and written presentations of information, views, and arguments. A transcript of each oral presentation shall be kept. Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to resolve an issue of fact material to a standard.

* (f) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The Secretary shall prescribe an effective date for a standard under this section. That date may not be earlier than the date the standard is prescribed nor later than 18 months after the date the standard is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a later date when the Secretary submits to Congress and publishes the reasons for the later date. A standard only applies to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured on or after the effective date.

* (g) RESEARCH.—The Secretary shall conduct research necessary to carry out this chapter.

### §32503. Judicial review of bumper standards
* (a) FILING AND VENUE.—A person that may be adversely affected by a standard prescribed under section 32502 of this title may apply for review of the standard by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of business. The petition must be filed not later than 59 days after the standard is prescribed.

* (b) NOTIFYING SECRETARY.—The clerk of the court shall send immediately a copy of the petition to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary shall file with the court a record of the proceeding in which the standard was prescribed.

* (c) ADDITIONAL PROCEEDINGS.—(1) On request of the petitioner, the court may order the Secretary to receive additional evidence and evidence in rebuttal if the court is satisfied the additional evidence is material and there were reasonable grounds for not presenting the evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary.

* (2) The Secretary may modify findings of fact or make new findings because of the additional evidence presented. The Secretary shall file a modified or new finding, a recommendation to modify or set aside a standard, and the additional evidence with the court.

* (d) SUPREME COURT REVIEW AND ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.—A judgment of a court under this section may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court under section 1254 of title 28. A remedy under this section is in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

### §32504. Certificates of compliance
* Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, a manufacturer or distributor of a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment subject to a standard prescribed under section 32502 of this title shall give the distributor or dealer at the time of delivery a certificate that the vehicle or equipment complies with the standard.

### §32505. Information and compliance requirements
