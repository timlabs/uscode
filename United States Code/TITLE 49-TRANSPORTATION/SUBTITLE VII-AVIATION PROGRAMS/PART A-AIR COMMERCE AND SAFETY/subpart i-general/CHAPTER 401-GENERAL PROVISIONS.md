However, the Secretary may exempt from section 42112(b)(1) and (2) an air carrier not providing scheduled air transportation, and the operations conducted during daylight hours by an air carrier providing scheduled air transportation, when the Secretary decides that—

  * (1) because of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operation of the air carrier, the enforcement of section 42112(b)(1) and (2) of this title is or would be an unreasonable burden on the air carrier that would obstruct its development and prevent it from beginning or continuing operations; and

  * (2) the exemption would not affect adversely the public interest.


* (e) MAXIMUM FLYING HOURS.—The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier under this section from a provision referred to in subsection (c) of this section, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, that sets maximum flying hours for pilots or copilots.

* (f) SMALLER AIRCRAFT.—(1) An air carrier is exempt from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, and the Secretary may exempt an air carrier from another provision of subpart II of this part, if the air carrier—

  * (ii) provides the transportation of cargo only with aircraft having a maximum payload of less than 18,000 pounds; and

  * (B) complies with liability insurance requirements and other regulations the Secretary prescribes.


* (2) The Secretary may increase the passenger or payload capacities when the public interest requires.

* (3)(A) An exemption under this subsection applies to an air carrier providing air transportation between 2 places in Alaska, or between Alaska and Canada, only if the carrier is authorized by Alaska to provide the transportation.

* (B) The Secretary may limit the number or location of places that may be served by an air carrier providing transportation only in Alaska under an exemption from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, or the frequency with which the transportation may be provided, only when the Secretary decides that providing the transportation substantially impairs the ability of an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary to provide its authorized transportation, including the minimum transportation requirement for Alaska specified under section 41732(b)(1)(B) of this title.

* (g) EMERGENCY AIR TRANSPORTATION BY FOREIGN AIR CARRIERS.—(1) To the extent that the Secretary decides an exemption is in the public interest, the Secretary may exempt by order a foreign air carrier from the requirements and limitations of this part for not more than 30 days to allow the foreign air carrier to carry passengers or cargo in interstate air transportation in certain markets if the Secretary finds that—

  * (A) because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of this title cannot accommodate traffic in those markets;

  * (B) all possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of the air carriers, including the use of—

    * (i) foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to the air carriers; and

    * (ii) the air carriers' reservations systems to the extent practicable;


  * (C) the exemption is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the markets that cannot be accommodated by the air carriers; and

  * (D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.


* (2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall—

  * (A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;

  * (B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and

  * (C) review the exemption at least every 30 days (or, in the case of an exemption that is necessary to provide and sustain air transportation in American Samoa between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a, at least every 180 days) to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.


* (3) RENEWAL OF EXEMPTIONS.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days.

* (b) REQUIRED FINDINGS.—The Administrator may make a contract under this section only if the Administrator finds that—

  * (1) there will be a continuing requirement for the service consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;

  * (2) providing the service will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or will incur a substantial contingent liability for assembling, training, or transporting a specialized workforce; and

  * (3) there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the proposed contract period the Administrator will request appropriations for the contract at the level required to avoid cancellation;

  * (4) there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with the property are not excessive; and

  * (5) the estimates of the contract costs and the anticipated savings from the contract are realistic.


* (c) REGULATIONS.—The Administrator shall prescribe regulations for acquiring property under this section to promote the use of contracts under this section in a way that will allow the most efficient use of those contracts. The regulations may provide for a cancellation provision in the contract to the extent the provision is necessary and in the best interest of the United States.

* (2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.

* (e) CANCELLATION PAYMENT AND NOTICE OF CANCELLATION CEILING.—(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.

* (2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.

### §40129. Collaborative decisionmaking pilot program
* (a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall establish a collaborative decisionmaking pilot program in accordance with this section.

* (b) DURATION.—Except as provided in subsection (k), the pilot program shall be in effect for a period of 2 years.

* (c) GUIDELINES.—

  * (1) ISSUANCE.—The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall issue guidelines concerning the pilot program. Such guidelines, at a minimum, shall—

    * (A) define a capacity reduction event;

    * (B) establish the criteria and process for determining when a capacity reduction event exists that warrants the use of collaborative decisionmaking among carriers at airports participating in the pilot program; and

    * (C) prescribe the methods of communication to be implemented among carriers during such an event.


  * (2) VIEWS.—The Administrator may obtain the views of interested parties in issuing the guidelines.


* (d) EFFECT OF DETERMINATION OF EXISTENCE OF CAPACITY REDUCTION EVENT.—Upon a determination by the Administrator that a capacity reduction event exists, the Administrator may authorize air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at an airport participating in the pilot program to communicate for a period of time not to exceed 24 hours with each other concerning changes in their respective flight schedules in order to use air traffic capacity most effectively. The Administration shall facilitate and monitor such communication. The Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, may monitor such communication.

* (e) SELECTION OF PARTICIPATING AIRPORTS.—Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Administrator establishes the pilot program, the Administrator shall select 2 airports to participate in the pilot program from among the most capacity-constrained airports in the Nation based on the Administration's Airport Capacity Benchmark Report 2001 or more recent data on airport capacity that is available to the Administrator. The Administrator shall select an airport for participation in the pilot program if the Administrator determines that collaborative decisionmaking among air carriers and foreign air carriers would reduce delays at the airport and have beneficial effects on reducing delays in the national airspace system as a whole.

* (f) ELIGIBILITY OF AIR CARRIERS.—An air carrier or foreign air carrier operating at an airport selected to participate in the pilot program is eligible to participate in the pilot program if the Administrator determines that the carrier has the operational and communications capability to participate in the pilot program.

* (g) MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF PILOT PROGRAM AT AN AIRPORT.—The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, may modify or end the pilot program at an airport before the term of the pilot program has expired, or may ban an air carrier or foreign air carrier from participating in the program, if the Administrator determines that the purpose of the pilot program is not being furthered by participation of the airport or air carrier or if the Secretary of Transportation, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, finds that the pilot program or the participation of an air carrier or foreign air carrier in the pilot program has had, or is having, an adverse effect on competition among carriers.

* (h) ANTITRUST IMMUNITY.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Unless, within 5 days after receiving notice from the Secretary of the Secretary's intention to exercise authority under this subsection, the Attorney General submits to the Secretary a written objection to such action, including reasons for such objection, the Secretary may exempt an air carrier's or foreign air carrier's activities that are necessary to participate in the pilot program under this section from the antitrust laws for the sole purpose of participating in the pilot program. Such exemption shall not extend to any discussions, agreements, or activities outside the scope of the pilot program.

  * (2) ANTITRUST LAWS DEFINED.—In this section, the term "antitrust laws" has the meaning given that term in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).


* (i) CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL.—The Secretary shall consult with the Attorney General regarding the design and implementation of the pilot program, including determining whether a limit should be set on the number of occasions collaborative decisionmaking could be employed during the initial 2-year period of the pilot program.

* (j) EVALUATION.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Before the expiration of the 2-year period for which the pilot program is authorized under subsection (b), the Administrator shall determine whether the pilot program has facilitated more effective use of air traffic capacity and the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall determine whether the pilot program has had an adverse effect on airline competition or the availability of air services to communities. The Administrator shall also examine whether capacity benefits resulting from the participation in the pilot program of an airport resulted in capacity benefits to other parts of the national airspace system.

  * (2) OBTAINING NECESSARY DATA.—The Administrator may require participating air carriers and airports to provide data necessary to evaluate the pilot program's impact.


* (k) EXTENSION OF PILOT PROGRAM.—At the end of the 2-year period for which the pilot program is authorized, the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, may continue the pilot program for an additional 2 years and expand participation in the program to up to 7 additional airports if the Administrator determines pursuant to subsection (j) that the pilot program has facilitated more effective use of air traffic capacity and if the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, determines that the pilot program has had no adverse effect on airline competition or the availability of air services to communities. The Administrator shall select the additional airports to participate in the extended pilot program in the same manner in which airports were initially selected to participate.

### §40130. FAA authority to conduct criminal history record checks
