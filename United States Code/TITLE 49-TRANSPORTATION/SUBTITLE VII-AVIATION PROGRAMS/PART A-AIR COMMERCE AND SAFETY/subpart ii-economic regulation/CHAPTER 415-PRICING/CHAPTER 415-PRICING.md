* Every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall establish, comply with, and enforce—

  * (1) reasonable prices, classifications, rules, and practices related to foreign air transportation; and

  * (2) for joint prices established for foreign air transportation, reasonable divisions of those prices among the participating air carriers or foreign air carriers without unreasonably discriminating against any of those carriers.

### §41502. Establishing joint prices for through routes with other carriers
* (a) JOINT PRICES.—An air carrier may establish reasonable joint prices and through service with another carrier. However, an air carrier not directly operating aircraft in air transportation (except an air express company) may not establish under this section a joint price for the transportation of property with a carrier subject to subtitle IV of this title.

* (b) PRICES, CLASSIFICATIONS, RULES, AND PRACTICES AND DIVISIONS OF JOINT PRICES.—For through service by an air carrier and a carrier subject to subtitle IV of this title, the participating carriers shall establish—

  * (1) reasonable prices and reasonable classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of the transportation provided under those prices; and

  * (2) for joint prices established for the through service, reasonable divisions of those joint prices among the participating carriers.


* (c) STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN TARIFFS.—An air carrier and a carrier subject to subtitle IV of this title that are participating in through service and joint prices shall include in their tariffs, filed with the Secretary of Transportation, a statement showing the through service and joint prices.

### §41503. Establishing joint prices for through routes provided by State authorized carriers
* Subject to sections 41309 and 42111 of this title, a citizen of the United States providing transportation under section 41101(b) of this title may make an agreement with an air carrier or foreign air carrier for joint prices for that transportation. The joint prices agreed to must be the lowest of—

  * (1) the sum of the applicable prices for—

    * (A) the part of the transportation provided in the State and approved by the appropriate State authority; and

    * (B) the part of the transportation provided by the air carrier or foreign air carrier;


  * (2) a joint price established and filed under section 41504 of this title; or

  * (3) a joint price prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation under section 41507 of this title.

### §41504. Tariffs for foreign air transportation
* (a) FILING AND CONTENTS.—In the way prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation, every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file with the Secretary, publish, and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing the prices for the foreign air transportation provided between places served by the carrier and provided between places served by the carrier and places served by another air carrier or foreign air carrier with which through service and joint prices have been established. A tariff—

  * (1) shall contain—

    * (A) to the extent the Secretary requires by regulation, a description of the classifications, rules, and practices related to the foreign air transportation;

    * (B) a statement of the prices in money of the United States; and

    * (C) other information the Secretary requires by regulation; and


  * (2) may contain—

    * (A) a statement of the prices in money that is not money of the United States; and

    * (B) information that is required under the laws of a foreign country in or to which the air carrier or foreign air carrier is authorized to operate.


* (b) CHANGES.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an air carrier or foreign air carrier may change a price or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price or the value of the transportation provided under that price, specified in a tariff of the carrier for foreign air transportation only after 30 days after the carrier has filed, published, and posted notice of the proposed change in the same way as required for a tariff under subsection (a) of this section. However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.

* (2) If the effect of a proposed change would be to begin a passenger fare that is outside of, or not covered by, the range of passenger fares specified under section 41509(e)(2) and (3) of this title, the proposed change may be put into effect only on the expiration of 60 days after the notice is filed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

* (c) REJECTION OF CHANGES.—The Secretary may reject a tariff or tariff change that is not consistent with this section and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A tariff or change that is rejected is void.

### §41505. Uniform methods for establishing joint prices, and divisions of joint prices, applicable to commuter air carriers
* (a) DEFINITION.—In this section, "commuter air carrier" means an air carrier providing transportation under section 40109(f) of this title that provides at least 5 scheduled roundtrips a week between the same 2 places.

* (b) GENERAL.—Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, when the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under section 41508 or 41509 of this title a uniform method generally applicable to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers holding certificates issued under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary shall make that uniform method apply to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers and commuter air carriers.

* (c) NOTICE REQUIRED BEFORE MODIFYING, SUSPENDING, OR ENDING TRANSPORTATION.—A commuter air carrier that has an agreement with an air carrier to provide transportation for passengers and property that includes through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes and air transportation provided by the air carrier shall give the air carrier and the Secretary at least 90 days' notice before modifying, suspending, or ending the transportation. If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.

### §41506. Price division filing requirements for foreign air transportation
* Every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall keep currently on file with the Secretary of Transportation, if the Secretary requires, the established divisions of all joint prices for foreign air transportation in which the carrier participates.

### §41507. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to change prices, classifications, rules, and practices for foreign air transportation
* (a) GENERAL.—When the Secretary of Transportation decides that a price charged or received by an air carrier or foreign air carrier for foreign air transportation, or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is or will be unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may—

  * (1) change the price, classification, rule, or practice as necessary to correct the discrimination; and

  * (2) order the air carrier or foreign air carrier to stop charging or collecting the discriminatory price or carrying out the discriminatory classification, rule, or practice.


* (b) WHEN SECRETARY MAY ACT.—The Secretary may act under this section on the Secretary's own initiative or on a complaint filed with the Secretary and only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

### §41508. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to adjust divisions of joint prices for foreign air transportation
* (a) GENERAL.—When the Secretary of Transportation decides that a division between air carriers, foreign air carriers, or both, of a joint price for foreign air transportation is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory against any of those carriers, the Secretary shall prescribe a reasonable division of the joint price among those carriers. The Secretary may order the adjustment in the division of the joint price to be made retroactively to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date the Secretary decides is reasonable.

* (b) WHEN SECRETARY MAY ACT.—The Secretary may act under this section on the Secretary's own initiative or on a complaint filed with the Secretary and only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

### §41509. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to suspend, cancel, and reject tariffs for foreign air transportation
* (a) CANCELLATION AND REJECTION.—(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.

* (2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.

* (3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider—

  * (A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;

  * (B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;

  * (C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;

  * (D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;

  * (E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;

  * (F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;

  * (G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and

  * (H) other factors.


* (b) SUSPENSION.—(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.

* (B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.

* (2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.

* (3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.

* (c) EFFECTIVE TARIFFS AND PRICES WHEN TARIFF IS SUSPENDED, CANCELED, OR REJECTED.—(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.

* (2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use—

  * (i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or

  * (ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.


* (B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.

* (3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.

* (d) RESPONSE TO REFUSAL OF FOREIGN COUNTRY TO ALLOW AIR CARRIER TO CHARGE A PRICE.—When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country—

  * (1) the Secretary, without a hearing—

    * (A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and

    * (B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and


  * (2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.


* (e) STANDARD FOREIGN FARE LEVEL.—(1)(A) In this subsection, "standard foreign fare level" means—

  * (i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96–192, 94 Stat. 46); or

  * (ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.


* (B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.

* (2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.

* (3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than—

  * (A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or

  * (B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.


* (f) SUBMISSION OF ORDERS TO PRESIDENT.—The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.

* (g) COMPLIANCE AS CONDITION OF CERTIFICATE OR PERMIT.—This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.

### §41510. Required adherence to foreign air transportation tariffs
* (a) PROHIBITED ACTIONS BY AIR CARRIERS, FOREIGN AIR CARRIERS, AND TICKET AGENTS.—An air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent may not—
