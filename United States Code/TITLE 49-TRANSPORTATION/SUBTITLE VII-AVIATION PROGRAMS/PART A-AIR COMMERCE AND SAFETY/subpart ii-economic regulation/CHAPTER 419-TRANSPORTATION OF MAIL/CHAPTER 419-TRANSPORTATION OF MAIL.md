  * (1) after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, reasonable prices to be paid by the Postal Service for the transportation of mail by aircraft between places in Alaska, the facilities used in and useful for the transportation of mail, and the services related to the transportation of mail for each carrier holding a certificate that authorizes that transportation;

* (c) OTHER TRANSPORTATION.—In prescribing prices under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may include transportation other than by aircraft that is incidental to transportation of mail by aircraft or necessary because of emergency conditions related to aircraft operations.

* (d) AUTHORITY TO PRESCRIBE DIFFERENT PRICES.—Considering conditions peculiar to transportation by aircraft and to particular air carriers or classes of air carriers, the Secretary may prescribe different prices under this section for different air carriers or classes of air carriers and for different classes of service. In prescribing a price for a carrier under this section, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors, the following:

  * (1) the condition that the carrier may hold and operate under a certificate authorizing the transportation of mail only by providing necessary and adequate facilities and service for the transportation of mail.

  * (2) standards related to the character and quality of service to be provided that are prescribed by or under law.


* (e) STATEMENTS ON PRICES.—A petition for prescribing a reasonable price under this section must include a statement of the price the petitioner believes is reasonable.

* (f) STATEMENTS ON REQUIRED SERVICES.—The Postal Service shall introduce as part of the record in every proceeding under this section a comprehensive statement of the services to be required of the air carrier and other information the Postal Service has that the Secretary considers material to the proceeding.

### §41902. Schedules for certain transportation of mail
* (a) REQUIREMENT.—Except as provided in section 41905 of this title and section 5402 of title 39, an air carrier may transport mail by aircraft between places in Alaska only under a schedule designated or required to be established under subsection (c) of this section for the transportation of mail.

* (b) STATEMENTS ON PLACES AND SCHEDULES.—Every air carrier shall file with the United States Postal Service a statement showing—

  * (1) the places between which the carrier is authorized to transport mail in Alaska;

  * (2) every schedule of aircraft regularly operated by the carrier between places described in paragraph (1) and every change in each schedule; and

  * (3) for each schedule, the places served by the carrier and the time of arrival at, and departure from, each such place.


* (c) DESIGNATING AND ADDITIONAL SCHEDULES.—The Postal Service may—

  * (1) designate any schedule of an air carrier filed under subsection (b)(2) of this section for the transportation of mail between the places between which the carrier is authorized by its certificate to transport mail; and

  * (2) require the carrier to establish additional schedules for the transportation of mail between those places.

* (b) MAXIMUM MAIL LOAD.—The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the maximum mail load for a schedule or for an aircraft or type of aircraft for the transportation of mail by aircraft between places in Alaska.

  * (1) provide facilities sufficient to transport the mail to the extent the Secretary decides the carrier reasonably is able to do so; and

  * (2) transport that mail.

### §41904. Noncitizens transporting mail
* When the United States Postal Service decides that it may be necessary to have a person not a citizen of the United States transport mail by aircraft between two points outside the United States, the Postal Service may make an arrangement with the person, without advertising, to provide the transportation. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the Postal Service to make arrangements with noncitizens for the carriage of mail in foreign air transportation under subsections 5402(b) and (c) of title 39.

### §41905. Emergency mail transportation
* (a) CONTRACT AUTHORITY.—In an emergency caused by a flood, fire, or other disaster, the United States Postal Service may make a contract without advertising to transport mail by aircraft to or from a locality affected by the emergency when the available facilities of persons authorized to transport mail to or from the locality are inadequate to meet the requirements of the Postal Service during the emergency. The contract may be only for periods necessary to maintain mail service because of the inadequacy of the facilities. Payment for transportation provided under the contract shall be made at prices provided in the contract.

* (b) TRANSPORTATION NOT AIR TRANSPORTATION.—Transportation provided under a contract made under subsection (a) of this section is not air transportation within the meaning of this part.

### §41908. Effect on foreign postal arrangements
* This part does not—

  * (1) affect an arrangement made by the United States Government with the postal administration of a foreign country related to the transportation of mail by aircraft; or
