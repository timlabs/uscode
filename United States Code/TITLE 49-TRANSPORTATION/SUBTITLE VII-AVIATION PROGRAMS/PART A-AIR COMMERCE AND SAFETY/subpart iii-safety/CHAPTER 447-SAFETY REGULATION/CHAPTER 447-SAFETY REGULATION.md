      * (v) the airworthiness directive is necessary to provide for the safe operation of the aircraft subject to the directive.


    * (B) ALTERNATIVE APPROVAL PROCESS.—Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Administrator may issue a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness directive instead of accepting an airworthiness directive otherwise eligible for acceptance under such subparagraph, if the Administrator determines that such issuance is necessary for safety or operational reasons due to the complexity or unique features of the Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness directive or the United States aviation system.

    * (C) ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF COMPLIANCE.—The Administrator may—

      * (i) accept an alternative means of compliance, with respect to an airworthiness directive accepted under subparagraph (A), that was approved by the aeronautical safety authority of the foreign country that issued the airworthiness directive; or
