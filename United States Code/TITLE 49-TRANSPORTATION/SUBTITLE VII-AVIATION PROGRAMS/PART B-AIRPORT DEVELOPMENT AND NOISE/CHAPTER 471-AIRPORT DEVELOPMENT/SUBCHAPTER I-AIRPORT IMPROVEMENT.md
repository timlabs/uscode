### SUBCHAPTER I—AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT

### §47101. Policies
* (a) GENERAL.—It is the policy of the United States—

  * (1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;

  * (2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;

  * (3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;

  * (4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;

  * (5) to encourage the development of intermodal connections on airport property between aeronautical and other transportation modes and systems to serve air transportation passengers and cargo efficiently and effectively and promote economic development;

  * (6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;

  * (7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;

  * (8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;

  * (9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity—

    * (A) are not in the public interest;

    * (B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and

    * (C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;


  * (10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;

  * (11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology (including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways and other runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices), concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;

  * (12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and

  * (13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.


* (b) NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY.—(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.

* (2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.

* (3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.

* (4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.

* (5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.

* (6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.

* (7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.

* (8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.

* (c) CAPACITY EXPANSION AND NOISE ABATEMENT.—It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.

* (d) CONSISTENCY WITH AIR COMMERCE AND SAFETY POLICIES.—Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.

* (e) ADEQUACY OF NAVIGATION AIDS AND AIRPORT FACILITIES.—This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include—

  * (1) reliever airports; and

  * (2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.


* (f) MAXIMUM USE OF SAFETY FACILITIES.—This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs—

  * (1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;

  * (2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;

  * (3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;

  * (4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;

  * (5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;

  * (6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;

  * (7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;

  * (8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;

  * (9) runway edge lighting and marking;

  * (10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area; and

  * (11) runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices, including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways.


* (g) INTERMODAL PLANNING.—To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall take each of the following actions:

  * (1) COORDINATION IN DEVELOPMENT OF AIRPORT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.—Cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.

  * (2) GOALS FOR AIRPORT MASTER AND SYSTEM PLANS.—Encourage airport sponsors and State and local officials to develop airport master plans and airport system plans that—

    * (A) foster effective coordination between aviation planning and metropolitan planning;

    * (B) include an evaluation of aviation needs within the context of multimodal planning;

    * (C) consider passenger convenience, airport ground access, and access to airport facilities; and

    * (D) are integrated with metropolitan plans to ensure that airport development proposals include adequate consideration of land use and ground transportation access.


  * (3) REPRESENTATION OF AIRPORT OPERATORS ON MPO'S.—Encourage metropolitan planning organizations, particularly in areas with populations greater than 200,000, to establish membership positions for airport operators.


* (h) CONSULTATION.—To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on—

  * (1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;

  * (2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;

* (4) If a fee imposed or collected for rent, landing, or service from an aircraft operator by an airport operated by Hawaii is increased during the period from May 4, 1990, through December 31, 1994, by more than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers for Honolulu, Hawaii, that the Secretary of Labor publishes during that period and if revenue derived from the fee increases because the fee increased, the amount under paragraph (3)(B) of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of the projected revenue increase in the period less the part of the increase attributable to changes in the Index in the period.

* (5) Hawaii shall determine costs, revenue, and projected revenue increases referred to in this subsection and shall submit the determinations to the Secretary of Transportation. A determination is approved unless the Secretary disapproves it not later than 30 days after it is submitted.

* (6) Hawaii is not eligible for a grant under section 47115 of this title in a fiscal year in which Hawaii uses under paragraph (2) of this subsection revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2). Hawaii shall repay amounts it receives in a fiscal year under a grant it is not eligible to receive because of this paragraph to the Secretary of Transportation for deposit in the discretionary fund established under section 47115.

* (7)(A) This subsection applies only to revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990, through December 30, 1994, and to amounts in the Airport Revenue Fund of Hawaii that are attributable to revenue before May 4, 1990, on sales referred to in paragraph (2).

* (B) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990, through December 30, 1994, may be used under paragraph (2) in any Hawaiian fiscal year, including a Hawaiian fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1994.

The Secretary may impose terms on the offer that the Secretary considers necessary to carry out this subchapter and regulations prescribed under this subchapter. An offer shall state the obligations to be assumed by the sponsor and the maximum amount the Government will pay for the project from the amounts authorized under chapter 481 of this title (except sections 48102(e), 48106, 48107, and 48110). At the request of the sponsor, an offer of a grant for a project that will not be completed in one fiscal year shall provide for the obligation of amounts apportioned or to be apportioned to a sponsor under section 47114(c) or 47114(d)(3)(A) of this title for the fiscal years necessary to pay the Government's share of the cost of the project. An offer that is accepted in writing by the sponsor is an agreement binding on the Government and the sponsor. The Government may pay or be obligated to pay a project cost only after a grant agreement for the project is signed.

* (b) INCREASING GOVERNMENT'S SHARE UNDER THIS SUBCHAPTER OR CHAPTER 475.—(1) When an offer has been accepted in writing, the amount stated in the offer as the maximum amount the Government will pay may be increased only as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

* (3) For a project receiving assistance under a grant approved under the Act, this subchapter, or chapter 475 of this title after September 30, 1987, the amount may be increased—

  * (A) for an airport development project, by not more than 15 percent; and

  * (B) for a grant after September 30, 1992, to acquire an interest in land for an airport (except a primary airport), by not more than the greater of the following, based on current creditable appraisals or a court award in a condemnation proceeding:

    * (i) 15 percent; or

    * (ii) 25 percent of the total increase in allowable project costs attributable to acquiring an interest in land.


* (c) INCREASING GOVERNMENT'S SHARE UNDER AIRPORT AND AIRWAY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1970.—For a project receiving assistance under a grant made under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, the maximum amount the Government will pay may be increased by not more than 10 percent. An increase under this subsection may be paid only from amounts the Government recovers from other grants made under the Act.

* (d) CHANGING WORKSCOPE.—With the consent of the sponsor, the Secretary may amend a grant agreement made under this subchapter to change the workscope of a project financed under the grant if the amendment does not result in an increase in the maximum amount the Government may pay under subsection (b) of this section.

* (e) CHANGE IN AIRPORT STATUS.—

  * (1) CHANGES TO NONPRIMARY AIRPORT STATUS.—If the status of a primary airport changes to a nonprimary airport at a time when a development project under a multiyear agreement under subsection (a) is not yet completed, the project shall remain eligible for funding from discretionary funds under section 47115 at the funding level and under the terms provided by the agreement, subject to the availability of funds.

  * (2) CHANGES TO NONCOMMERCIAL SERVICE AIRPORT STATUS.—If the status of a commercial service airport changes to a noncommercial service airport at a time when a terminal development project under a phased-funding arrangement is not yet completed, the project shall remain eligible for funding from discretionary funds under section 47115 at the funding level and under the terms provided by the arrangement subject to the availability of funds.

  * (3) CHANGES TO NONHUB PRIMARY STATUS.—If the status of a nonhub primary airport changes to a small hub primary airport at a time when the airport has received discretionary funds under this chapter for a terminal development project in accordance with section 47119(a), and the project is not yet completed, the project shall remain eligible for funding from the discretionary fund and the small airport fund to pay costs allowable under section 47119(a). Such project shall remain eligible for such funds for three fiscal years after the start of construction of the project, or if the Secretary determines that a further extension of eligibility is justified, until the project is completed.

### §47109. United States Government's share of project costs
* (a) GENERAL.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, the United States Government's share of allowable project costs is—

  * (1) 75 percent for a project at a medium or large hub airport;

    * (A) the Administrator determines is a successive phase of a multiphase construction project for which the sponsor received a grant in fiscal year 2011; and

    * (B) for which the United States Government's share of allowable project costs would otherwise be capped at 90 percent under paragraph (2) or (3).


* (b) INCREASED GOVERNMENT SHARE.—If, under subsection (a) of this section, the Government's share of allowable costs of a project in a State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands (individual and tribal) of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State, is less than the share applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, the Government's share under subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by the lesser of—

  * (1) 25 percent;

  * (2) one-half of the percentage that the area of unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands in the State is of the total area of the State; or

  * (3) the percentage necessary to increase the Government's share to the percentage that applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Act.


* (c) GRANDFATHER RULE.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of any project approved after September 30, 2003, at a small hub airport or nonhub airport that is located in a State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands (individual and tribal) of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State, the Government's share of allowable costs of the project shall be increased by the same ratio as the basic share of allowable costs of a project divided into the increased (Public Lands States) share of allowable costs of a project as shown on documents of the Federal Aviation Administration dated August 3, 1979, at airports for which the general share was 80 percent on August 3, 1979. This subsection shall apply only if—

    * (A) the State contained unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands of more than 5 percent of the total area of all lands in the State on August 3, 1979; and

    * (B) the application under subsection (b), does not increase the Government's share of allowable costs of the project.


  * (2) The Government's share of allowable project costs determined under this subsection shall not exceed the lesser of 93.75 percent or the highest percentage Government share applicable to any project in any State under subsection (b), except that at a primary non-hub and non-primary commercial service airport located in a State as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection that is within 15 miles of another State as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Government's share shall be an average of the Government share applicable to any project in each of the States.


* (d) SPECIAL RULE FOR PRIVATELY OWNED RELIEVER AIRPORTS.—If a privately owned reliever airport contributes any lands, easements, or rights-of-way to carry out a project under this subchapter, the current fair market value of such lands, easements, or rights-of-way shall be credited toward the non-Federal share of allowable project costs.

* (e) SPECIAL RULE FOR TRANSITION FROM SMALL HUB TO MEDIUM HUB STATUS.—If the status of a small hub airport changes to a medium hub airport, the Government's share of allowable project costs for the airport may not exceed 90 percent for the first 2 fiscal years after such change in hub status.

* (f) SPECIAL RULE FOR ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES.—The Government's share of allowable project costs shall be 95 percent for a project at an airport that—

  * (1) is receiving essential air service for which compensation was provided to an air carrier under subchapter II of chapter 417; and

  * (2) is located in an area that meets one or more of the criteria established in section 301(a) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3161(a)), as determined by the Secretary of Commerce.

* (b) ALLOWABLE COST STANDARDS.—A project cost is allowable—

  * (1) if the cost necessarily is incurred in carrying out the project in compliance with the grant agreement made for the project under this subchapter, including any cost a sponsor incurs related to an audit the Secretary requires under section 47121(b) or (d) of this title and any cost of moving a Federal facility impeding the project if the rebuilt facility is of an equivalent size and type;

  * (2)(A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;

  * (B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989, by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatibility program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements;

  * (C) if the Government's share is paid only with amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) or section 47114(d)(3)(A) and if the cost is incurred—

    * (i) after September 30, 1996;

    * (ii) before a grant agreement is executed for the project; and

    * (iii) in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after the grant agreement had been executed; or


  * (D) if the cost is for airport development and is incurred before execution of the grant agreement, but in the same fiscal year as execution of the grant agreement, and if—

    * (i) the cost was incurred before execution of the grant agreement because the airport has a shortened construction season due to climatic conditions in the vicinity of the airport;

    * (ii) the cost is in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after execution of the grant agreement, including submission of a complete grant application to the appropriate regional or district office of the Federal Aviation Administration;

    * (iii) the sponsor notifies the Secretary before authorizing work to commence on the project;

    * (iv) the sponsor has an alternative funding source available to fund the project; and

  * (3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;

  * (4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted;

  * (5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title);

  * (6) if the cost is for a project not described in section 47102(3) for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and ground support equipment owned by an airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology, as determined by the Secretary; and

  * (7) if the cost is incurred on a measure to improve the efficiency of an airport building (such as a measure designed to meet one or more of the criteria for being considered a high-performance green building as set forth under section 401(13) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17061(13))) and—

    * (A) the measure is for a project for airport development;

    * (B) the measure is for an airport building that is otherwise eligible for construction assistance under this subchapter; and

    * (C) if the measure results in an increase in initial project costs, the increase is justified by expected savings over the life cycle of the project.


* (c) CERTAIN PRIOR COSTS AS ALLOWABLE COSTS.—The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is—

* (3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.

* (4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title, less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.

* (5) LETTERS OF INTENT.—The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility charge under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.

  * (1) GENERAL RULE.—Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.

  * (2) REQUIRED FINDING.—Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after August 23, 1994, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.


* (g) MINIMUM AMOUNT TO BE CREDITED.—

  * (1) GENERAL RULE.—In a fiscal year, there shall be credited to the fund, out of amounts made available under section 48103 of this title, an amount that is at least equal to the sum of—

    * (A) $148,000,000; plus

* The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.

  * (2) REDUCTION OF APPORTIONMENTS.—In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) is less than the minimum amount to be credited under paragraph (1), the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals such minimum amount.

  * (3) AMOUNT OF REDUCTION.—For a fiscal year, the total amount available to make a reduction to carry out paragraph (2) is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A), 47114(c)(2), 47114(d), and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary finds that all or part of an amount of an apportionment under section 47114 is not required during a fiscal year to fund a grant for which the apportionment may be used, the Secretary may use during such fiscal year the amount not so required to make grants for any purpose for which grants may be made under section 48103. The finding may be based on the notifications that the Secretary receives under section 47105(f) or on other information received from airport sponsors.

  * (2) RESTORATION OF APPORTIONMENTS.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—If the fiscal year for which a finding is made under paragraph (1) with respect to an apportionment is not the last fiscal year of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b), the Secretary shall restore to the apportionment an amount equal to the amount of the apportionment used under paragraph (1) for a discretionary grant whenever a sufficient amount is made available under section 48103.

    * (B) PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY.—If restoration under this paragraph is made in the fiscal year for which the finding is made or the succeeding fiscal year, the amount restored shall be subject to the original period of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b). If the restoration is made thereafter, the amount restored shall remain available in accordance with subsection (b) for the original period of availability of the apportionment plus the number of fiscal years during which a sufficient amount was not available for the restoration.


  * (3) NEWLY AVAILABLE AMOUNTS.—

    * (A) RESTORED AMOUNTS TO BE UNAVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY GRANTS.—Of an amount newly available under section 48103 of this title, an amount equal to the amounts restored under paragraph (2) shall not be available for discretionary grant obligations under section 47115.

    * (B) USE OF REMAINING AMOUNTS.—Subparagraph (A) does not impair the Secretary's authority under paragraph (1), after a restoration under paragraph (2), to apply all or part of a restored amount that is not required to fund a grant under an apportionment to fund discretionary grants.


  * (4) LIMITATIONS ON OBLIGATIONS APPLY.—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to incur grant obligations under section 47104 for a fiscal year in an amount greater than the amount made available under section 48103 for such obligations for such fiscal year.


* (g) LIMITING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY.—The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.
