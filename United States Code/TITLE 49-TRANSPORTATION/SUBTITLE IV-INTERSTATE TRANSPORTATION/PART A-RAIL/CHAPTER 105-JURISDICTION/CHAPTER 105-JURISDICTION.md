* (a) In a matter related to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, the Board, to the maximum extent consistent with this part, shall exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service whenever the Board finds that the application in whole or in part of a provision of this part—

  * (1) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and

  * (2) either—

    * (A) the transaction or service is of limited scope; or

    * (B) the application in whole or in part of the provision is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.


* (b) The Board may, where appropriate, begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application by the Secretary of Transportation or an interested party.

Any proceeding begun as a result of an application under this subsection shall be completed within 9 months after it is begun.

* (c) The Board may specify the period of time during which an exemption granted under this section is effective.

* (d) The Board may revoke an exemption, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application in whole or in part of a provision of this part to the person, class, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Board shall, within 90 days after receipt of a request for revocation under this subsection, determine whether to begin an appropriate proceeding.
