* (a) REASONABLENESS.—

  * (1) CERTAIN HOUSEHOLD GOODS TRANSPORTATION; JOINT RATES INVOLVING WATER TRANSPORTATION.—A rate, classification, rule, or practice related to transportation or service provided by a carrier subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 for transportation or service involving—

    * (A) a movement of household goods,

    * (B) a rate for a movement by or with a water carrier in noncontiguous domestic trade, or

    * (C) rates, rules, and classifications made collectively by motor carriers under agreements approved pursuant to section 13703,


* must be reasonable.

  * (2) THROUGH ROUTES AND DIVISIONS OF JOINT RATES.—Through routes and divisions of joint rates for such transportation or service must be reasonable.


* (b) PRESCRIPTION BY BOARD FOR VIOLATIONS.—When the Board finds it necessary to stop or prevent a violation of subsection (a), the Board shall prescribe the rate, classification, rule, practice, through route, or division of joint rates to be applied for such transportation or service.

* (c) FILING OF COMPLAINT.—A complaint that a rate, classification, rule, or practice in noncontiguous domestic trade violates subsection (a) may be filed with the Board.

* (d) ZONE OF REASONABLENESS.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this section, a rate or division of a motor carrier for service in noncontiguous domestic trade or water carrier for port-to-port service in that trade is reasonable if the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate or division is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate or division in effect 1 year before the effective date of the proposed rate or division.

  * (2) ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ZONE.—The percentage specified in paragraph (1) shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the most recent 1-year period before the date the rate or division in question first took effect.

  * (3) DETERMINATIONS AFTER COMPLAINT.—The Board shall determine whether any rate or division of a carrier or service in noncontiguous domestic trade which is not within the range described in paragraph (1) is reasonable if a complaint is filed under subsection (c) or section 13702(b)(6).

  * (4) REPARATIONS.—Upon a finding of violation of subsection (a), the Board shall award reparations to the complaining shipper or shippers in an amount equal to all sums assessed and collected that exceed the determined reasonable rate, division, rate structure, or tariff. Upon complaint from any governmental agency or authority and upon a finding or violation of subsection (a), the Board shall make such orders as are just and shall require the carrier to return, to the extent practicable, to shippers all amounts plus interest, which the Board finds to have been assessed and collected in violation of subsection (a).

### §13702. Tariff requirement for certain transportation
* (a) IN GENERAL.—Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes without charge, a carrier subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 may provide transportation or service that is—

  * (1) in noncontiguous domestic trade, except with regard to bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, waste paper, and paper waste; or

  * (2) for movement of household goods;


* only if the rate for such transportation or service is contained in a tariff that is in effect under this section. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, giving a person a privilege, allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of that transportation or service, or another device. A rate contained in a tariff shall be stated in money of the United States.

* (b) TARIFF REQUIREMENTS FOR NONCONTIGUOUS DOMESTIC TRADE.—

  * (1) FILING.—A carrier providing transportation or service described in subsection (a)(1) shall publish and file with the Board tariffs containing the rates established for such transportation or service. The carriers shall keep such tariffs available for public inspection. The Board shall prescribe the form and manner of publishing, filing, and keeping tariffs available for public inspection under this subsection.

  * (2) CONTENTS.—The Board may prescribe any specific information and charges to be identified in a tariff, but at a minimum tariffs must identify plainly—

    * (A) the carriers that are parties to it;

    * (B) the places between which property will be transported;

    * (C) terminal charges if a carrier provides transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter III of chapter 135;

    * (D) privileges given and facilities allowed; and

    * (E) any rules that change, affect, or determine any part of the published rate.


  * (3) INLAND DIVISIONS.—A carrier providing transportation or service described in subsection (a)(1) under a joint rate for a through movement shall not be required to state separately or otherwise reveal in tariff filings the inland divisions of that through rate.

  * (4) TIME-VOLUME RATES.—Rates in tariffs filed under this subsection may vary with the volume of cargo offered over a specified period of time.

  * (5) CHANGES.—The Board may permit carriers to change rates, classifications, rules, and practices without filing complete tariffs under this subsection that cover matter that is not being changed when the Board finds that action to be consistent with the public interest. Those carriers may either—

    * (A) publish new tariffs that incorporate changes, or

    * (B) plainly indicate the proposed changes in the tariffs then in effect and make the tariffs as changed available for public inspection.


  * (6) COMPLAINTS.—A complaint that a rate or related rule or practice maintained in a tariff under this subsection violates section 13701(a) may be submitted to the Board for resolution.


* (c) TARIFF REQUIREMENTS FOR HOUSEHOLD GOODS CARRIERS.—

  * (2) NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY.—A carrier that maintains a tariff under this subsection may not enforce the provisions of the tariff unless the carrier has given notice that the tariff is available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to the tariff.

  * (3) REQUIREMENTS.—A carrier that maintains a tariff under this subsection is bound by the tariff except as otherwise provided in this part. A tariff that does not comply with this subsection may not be enforced against any individual shipper.

  * (4) INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE.—A carrier may incorporate by reference the rates, terms, and other conditions of a tariff in agreements covering the transportation of household goods.

### §13704. Household goods rates—estimates; guarantees of service
* (a) IN GENERAL.—

  * (1) AUTHORITY.—Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may establish a rate for the transportation of household goods which is based on the carrier's written, binding estimate of charges for providing such transportation.

  * (2) NONPREFERENTIAL; NONPREDATORY.—Any rate established under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential basis to shippers and must not result in charges to shippers which are predatory.


* (b) RATES FOR GUARANTEED SERVICE.—

  * (1) AUTHORITY.—Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may establish rates for the transportation of household goods which guarantee that the carrier will pick up and deliver such household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver such household goods at the specified time. The charges, if any, for such guarantee and penalty provision may vary to reflect one or more options available to meet a particular shipper's needs.

  * (2) AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY TO REQUIRE NONGUARANTEED SERVICE RATES.—Before a carrier may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may require such carrier to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under paragraph (1), a rate for such service which does not guarantee the pick up and delivery of household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and which does not provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver household goods at the specified time.

### §13705. Requirements for through routes among motor carriers of passengers
* (a) ESTABLISHMENT; REASONABLENESS.—A motor carrier providing transportation of passengers subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall establish through routes with other carriers of the same type and shall establish individual and joint rates applicable to them.

### §13706. Liability for payment of rates
* (a) LIABILITY OF CONSIGNEE.—Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this section when the transportation is provided by motor carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property—

  * (1) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and

  * (2) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.


* (b) LIABILITY OF BENEFICIAL OWNER.—When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under subsection (a), the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of the lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.

### §13707. Payment of rates
* (a) TRANSFER OF POSSESSION UPON PAYMENT.—Except as provided in subsection (b), a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under this part shall give up possession at the destination of the property transported by it only when payment for the transportation or service is made.

* (b) EXCEPTIONS.—

  * (1) REGULATIONS.—Under regulations of the Secretary governing the payment for transportation and service and preventing discrimination, those carriers may give up possession at destination of property transported by them before payment for the transportation or service. The regulations of the Secretary may provide for weekly or monthly payment for transportation provided by motor carriers and for periodic payment for transportation provided by water carriers.

  * (2) EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES.—Such a carrier (including a motor carrier being used by a household goods freight forwarder) may extend credit for transporting property for the United States Government, a State, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of any of them.

  * (3) SHIPMENTS OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—A carrier providing transportation of a shipment of household goods shall give up possession of the household goods being transported at the destination upon payment of—

      * (i) 100 percent of the charges contained in a binding estimate provided by the carrier;

      * (ii) not more than 110 percent of the charges contained in a nonbinding estimate provided by the carrier; or

      * (iii) in the case of a partial delivery of the shipment, the prorated percentage of the charges calculated in accordance with subparagraph (B).


    * (B) CALCULATION OF PRORATED CHARGES.—For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), the prorated percentage of the charges shall be the percentage of the total charges due to the carrier as described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) that is equal to the percentage of the weight of that portion of the shipment delivered to the total weight of the shipment.

    * (C) POST-CONTRACT SERVICES.—Subparagraph (A) does not apply to additional services requested by a shipper after the contract of service is executed that were not included in the estimate.

    * (D) IMPRACTICABLE OPERATIONS.—Subparagraph (A) does not apply to impracticable operations, as defined by the applicable carrier tariff, except that the charges collected at delivery for such operations shall not exceed 15 percent of all other charges due at delivery. Any remaining charges due shall be paid within 30 days after the carrier presents its freight bill.

### §13708. Billing and collecting practices
* (a) DISCLOSURE.—A motor carrier subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall disclose, when a document is presented or electronically transmitted for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier for payment or agent of such responsible person, the actual rates, charges, or allowances for any transportation service and shall also disclose, at such time, whether and to whom any allowance or reduction in charges is made.

* (b) FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION.—No person may cause a motor carrier to present false or misleading information on a document about the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction.

* (c) ALLOWANCES FOR SERVICES.—When the actual rate, charge, or allowance is dependent upon the performance of a service by a party to the transportation arrangement, such as tendering a volume of freight over a stated period of time, the motor carrier shall indicate in any document presented for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier that a reduction, allowance, or other adjustment may apply.

### §13709. Procedures for resolving claims involving unfiled, negotiated transportation rates
* (a) TRANSPORTATION PROVIDED AT RATES OTHER THAN LEGAL TARIFF RATES.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—When a claim is made by a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 (as in effect on December 31, 1995) or subchapter I of chapter 135, by a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or by a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder regarding the collection of rates or charges for such transportation in addition to those originally billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder for such transportation, the person against whom the claim is made may elect to satisfy the claim under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), or (d), upon showing that—

  * (2) REASONABLENESS OF RATES; COLLECTING ADDITIONAL CHARGES.—When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Board shall determine whether such rates and provisions are reasonable under section 13701 or applicable based on the record before it.

  * (3) BILLING DISPUTES.—

    * (A) INITIATED BY MOTOR CARRIERS.—In those cases where a motor carrier (other than a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier may request that the Board determine whether any additional charges over those billed and collected must be paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the receipt of the original bill in order to have the right to collect such charges.

    * (B) INITIATED BY SHIPPERS.—If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed or additional charges subsequently billed, the shipper may request that the Board determine whether the charges billed must be paid.

### §13711. Alternative procedure for resolving undercharge disputes
* (a) GENERAL RULE.—It shall be an unreasonable practice for a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 or, before January 1, 1996, to have provided transportation that was subject to jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105, as in effect on December 31, 1995, a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder to attempt to charge or to charge for a transportation service the difference between (1) the applicable rate that was lawfully in effect pursuant to a tariff that was filed in accordance with this chapter or, with respect to transportation provided before January 1, 1996, in accordance with chapter 107, as in effect on the date the transportation was provided, by the carrier or freight forwarder applicable to such transportation service, and (2) the negotiated rate for such transportation service if the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property between places described in section 13501(1) or is transporting property between places described in section 13501(1) for the purpose of avoiding application of this section.

* (b) JURISDICTION OF BOARD.—

  * (1) DETERMINATION.—The Board shall have jurisdiction to make a determination of whether or not attempting to charge or the charging of a rate by a motor carrier or freight forwarder or party representing a motor carrier or freight forwarder is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a). If the Board determines that attempting to charge or the charging of the rate is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a), the carrier, freight forwarder, or party may not collect the difference described in subsection (a) between the applicable rate and the negotiated rate for the transportation service.

  * (2) FACTORS TO CONSIDER.—In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider—

    * (A) whether the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder or party other than that legally on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, at the time of the movement for the transportation service;

    * (B) whether the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;
