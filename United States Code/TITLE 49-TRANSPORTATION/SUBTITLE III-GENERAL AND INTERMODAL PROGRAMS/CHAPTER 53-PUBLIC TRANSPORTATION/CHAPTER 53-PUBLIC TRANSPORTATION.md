The regulations shall permit such operations to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol.

* (B) When the Secretary considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for conducting periodic recurring testing of public transportation employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.

* (2) In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary—

  * (A) shall require that post-accident testing of such a public transportation employee be conducted when loss of human life occurs in an accident involving public transportation; and

  * (B) may require that post-accident testing of such a public transportation employee be conducted when bodily injury or significant property damage occurs in any other serious accident involving public transportation.


* (c) DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR USE.—(1) When the Secretary considers it appropriate, the Secretary shall require disqualification for an established period of time or dismissal of any employee referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section who is found—

  * (A) to have used or been impaired by alcohol when on duty; or

  * (B) to have used a controlled substance, whether or not on duty, except as allowed for medical purposes by law or regulation.

* (d) TESTING AND LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS.—In carrying out subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall develop requirements that shall—

  * (1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimens;

  * (2) for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any amendments to those guidelines, including mandatory guidelines establishing—

    * (A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;

    * (B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and

    * (C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;


  * (3) require that a laboratory involved in controlled substances testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;

  * (4) provide that all tests indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;

  * (5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;

  * (6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;

  * (7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and

  * (8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.


* (e) REHABILITATION.—The Secretary shall prescribe regulations establishing requirements for rehabilitation programs that provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of any public transportation employee referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section who is found to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation. The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. This subsection does not prevent a public transportation operation from establishing a program under this section in cooperation with another public transportation operation.

* (f) RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS, REGULATIONS, STANDARDS, AND ORDERS.—(1) A State or local government may not prescribe, issue, or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this section.

  * (1) APPORTIONMENT AMONG STATES.—The amounts apportioned under subsection (b)(1) shall provide each State with an amount equal to the total amount apportioned multiplied by a ratio equal to the population of that State forecast for the year that is 15 years after the most recent decennial census, divided by the total population of all States forecast for the year that is 15 years after the most recent decennial census. Such forecast shall be based on the population trend for each State between the most recent decennial census and the most recent estimate of population made by the Secretary of Commerce.

  * (2) APPORTIONMENTS BETWEEN URBANIZED AREAS AND OTHER THAN URBANIZED AREAS IN EACH STATE.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall apportion amounts to each State under paragraph (1) so that urbanized areas in that State receive an amount equal to the amount apportioned to that State multiplied by a ratio equal to the sum of the forecast population of all urbanized areas in that State divided by the total forecast population of that State. In making the apportionment under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall utilize any available forecasts made by the State. If no forecasts are available, the Secretary shall utilize data on urbanized areas and total population from the most recent decennial census.

    * (B) REMAINING AMOUNTS.—Amounts remaining for each State after apportionment under subparagraph (A) shall be apportioned to that State and added to the amount made available for grants under section 5311.

    * (A) the total land area of the State (in square miles); multiplied by

    * (B) 370; multiplied by

    * (C)(i) the population of the State in urbanized areas; divided by

    * (ii) the total population of the State.


  * (3) STATE APPORTIONMENT FACTOR.—For each State qualifying for an apportionment under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall calculate an amount equal to the difference between the total population of the State less the amount calculated in paragraph (2).

  * (4) STATE APPORTIONMENT.—Each State qualifying for an apportionment under paragraph (1) shall receive an amount equal to the amount to be apportioned under this subsection multiplied by the amount calculated for the State under paragraph (3) divided by the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraph (3) for all States qualifying for an apportionment under paragraph (1).

  * (5) APPORTIONMENTS AMONG URBANIZED AREAS IN EACH STATE.—The Secretary shall apportion amounts made available to each State under paragraph (4) so that each urbanized area receives an amount equal to the amount apportioned under paragraph (4) multiplied by a ratio equal to the population of each urbanized area divided by the sum of populations of all urbanized areas in the State.
