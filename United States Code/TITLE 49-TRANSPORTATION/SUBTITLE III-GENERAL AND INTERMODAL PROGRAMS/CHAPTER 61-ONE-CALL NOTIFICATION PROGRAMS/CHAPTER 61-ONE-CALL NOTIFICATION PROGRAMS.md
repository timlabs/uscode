  * (1) ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.—The term "one-call notification system" means a system operated by an organization that has as 1 of its purposes to receive notification from excavators of intended excavation in a specified area in order to disseminate such notification to underground facility operators that are members of the system so that such operators can locate and mark their facilities in order to prevent damage to underground facilities in the course of such excavation.

  * (2) STATE ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION PROGRAM.—The term "State one-call notification program" means the State statutes, regulations, orders, judicial decisions, and other elements of law and policy in effect in a State that establish the requirements for the operation of one-call notification systems in such State.
