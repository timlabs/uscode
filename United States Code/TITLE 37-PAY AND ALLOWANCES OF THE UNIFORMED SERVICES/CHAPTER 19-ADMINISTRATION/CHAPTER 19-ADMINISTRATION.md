* (c) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may obtain from the Comptroller General an advisory opinion with respect to a proposed regulation especially affecting a department under that Secretary's jurisdiction.

### §1002. Additional training or duty without pay: Reserves and members of National Guard
* (a) A member of the National Guard, or of a reserve component of a uniformed service, may, with his consent, be given additional training or other duty as provided by law, without pay, as may be authorized by the Secretary concerned.

* (b)(1) A member who performs training or other duty without pay under subsection (a) may, in the discretion of the Secretary concerned, be authorized the travel and transportation allowances prescribed by section 474(a)–(d), and (f), of this title for travel performed to and from that training or duty, and, during the performance of that training or duty, be furnished with subsistence and quarters in kind or commutation thereof at a rate to be fixed by the Secretary concerned.

* (2) If a military technician (dual status), as described in section 10216 of title 10, is performing active duty without pay while on leave from technician employment, as authorized by section 6323(d) of title 5, the Secretary concerned may authorize the payment of a per diem allowance to the military technician in lieu of commutation for subsistence and quarters under paragraph (1).

* (c) This section does not authorize compensation for work or study performed by a member of a reserve component in connection with correspondence courses of an armed force.

* (d) This section does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.

### §1003. Assimilation of pay and allowances
* Chapters 3 and 5 and sections 402–403b, 474–477, 479–481, and 414 of this title apply equally to persons who are not serving as members of a uniformed service but whose pay or allowances, or both, are assimilated under law or a regulation prescribed under law, to the pay or allowances, or both, of commissioned officers, warrant officers, or enlisted members of any grade, rank, or rating in any uniformed service.

### §1004. Computation of pay and allowances for month or part of month
* A member of a uniformed service who is entitled to pay and allowances under this title for a continuous period of less than one month is entitled to his pay and allowances for each day of that period at the rate of 1/30 of the monthly amount of his pay and allowances. The thirty-first day of a calendar month may not be excluded from a computation under this section.

### §1005. Army, Air Force, and Space Force: prompt payments required
* Members of the Army, the Air Force, and the Space Force shall be paid at such times that arrears will at no time be more than two months, unless circumstances make further arrears unavoidable.

### §1006. Advance payments
* (a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service may be paid in advance—

  * (1) not more than three months' pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or

  * (2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.


* (b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.

* (c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months' basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority. An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located. In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member. The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.

* (d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount remaining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned. However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.

* (e)(1) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)–(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.

* (2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an obligation for an advance of pay made pursuant to this section shall be recorded as an obligation only in the fiscal year in which the entitlement of the member to the pay accrues.

* (B) Current appropriations available for advance payments under this section may be transferred to the prior fiscal year appropriation available for the same purpose in the amount of any unliquidated advance payments that remain at the end of such prior fiscal year. Such unliquidated advance payments shall then be credited to the current appropriation.

* (f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an advance of pay of not more than three months' pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas. In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.

* (g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 477 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 475a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.

* (h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period. If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.

* (b) An amount due to the United States from an enlisted member of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force for articles sold to the member on credit under section 4621(a)(1) or 9621(a)(1) of title 10, as the case may be, shall be deducted from the next pay due the member after the sale is reported.

* (f) If, upon final settlement of the accounts of an officer of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force charged with the issue of an article of military supply, there is a deficiency of that article, or if an article of military supply with whose issue an officer is charged is damaged, the value of the lost article or the amount of the damage shall be charged against the officer and deducted from the officer's monthly pay, unless the officer shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force, as the case may be, by one or more affidavits setting forth the circumstances, that the officer was not at fault.
