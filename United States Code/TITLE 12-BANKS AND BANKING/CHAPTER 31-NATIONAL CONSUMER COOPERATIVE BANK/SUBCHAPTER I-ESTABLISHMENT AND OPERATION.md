* The Bank may make loans and commitments for loans under this subsection to any organization determined by the Bank to be eligible under the provisions of section 3015 of this title, and may purchase or discount obligations of members of such organizations if the Bank, to the exclusion of all other persons, entities, agencies, or jurisdictions, also determines that the applicant has or will have a sound organizational and financial structure, income in excess of its operating costs and assets in excess of its obligations, and a reasonable expectation of a continuing demand for its production, goods, commodities, or services, or the use of its facilities, so that the loan will be fully repayable in accordance with its terms and conditions. Commencing on October 1, 1985, the Bank shall not make any loan to a cooperative for the purpose of financing the construction, ownership, acquisition, or improvement of any structure used primarily for residential purposes if, after giving effect to such loan, the aggregate amount of all loans outstanding for such purpose would exceed 30 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank.

  * (1) cooperatives at least a majority of the members of which are low-income persons, and

* The Board shall adopt and publish in the Federal Register rules defining the term "low-income persons" for purposes of this subsection. The criteria to be applied and the factors to be considered by the Bank in making loans, loan commitments, purchases, discounts, and guarantees shall include an assessment of the impact of the loan on existing small businesses in the eligible organizations' business territory. The criteria and factors shall be stated in rules of the Bank which shall be published and made available to applicants and, upon request, to any other person or organization.

* Loans under this section shall be repayable in not more than forty years and, except for loans with final due date not longer than five years from the date of the loan, shall be amortized as to principal and interest. In setting the terms, rates, and charges, it shall be the objective of the Bank to provide the type of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the Bank, necessary reserve and expenses of the Bank, and the technical and other assistance attributable to loans under this section made available by the Bank. The loan terms may provide for interest rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rates being charged by the Bank for new loans at such times. The proceeds of a loan under this subsection may be advanced by the borrower to its members or stockholders under circumstances described in the bylaws or rules of the Bank.

#### (c) Guarantees by Bank; requirements; charges
* Subject to section 3012(13) of this title, the Bank may guarantee all or any part of the principal and interest of any loan made by any State or federally chartered lending institution to any borrower if such loan is to an organization that would be an eligible borrower from the Bank for a direct loan and is on terms and conditions (including the rate of interest) which would be permissible terms and conditions for such a direct loan. The Bank may impose a charge for any such guarantee. No loan may be guaranteed by the Bank if the income therefrom to the lender is excluded from such lender's gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.

#### (d) Assignment of guaranteed loans; contestability of guarantee; criteria for purchase by Bank of guaranteed loan in lieu of requiring service by lender
* Any loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be assignable to the extent provided in the contract of guarantee as may be determined by the Bank. The guarantee shall be uncontestable, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time he acquired the loan. The Bank in lieu of requiring such lender to service such guaranteed loan until final maturity or liquidation, may purchase the loan for the balance of the principal and accrued interest thereon without penalty, if it determines that (1) the liquidation of the loan would result in the insolvency of the borrower or deprive the borrower of assets essential to its continued operation, and (2) the loan will be repayable with revision of the loan rates, terms, or payment periods or other conditions not inconsistent with loans made by the Bank under subsection (a) of this section, which revisions the lender or other holder of such guaranteed loan is unwilling to make.

#### (e) Aggregate amount of commitments to make or guarantee loans
* As long as any of the class A stock of the Bank is held by the Secretary of the Treasury, the aggregate amount of commitments by the Bank to make or guarantee loans shall not exceed such amounts as may be specified in annual appropriation Acts.

### §3019. Taxation by State, county, etc., taxing authority; Federal tax status
* (a) The Bank, including its franchise, capital, reserves, surplus, mortgages, or other security holdings and income shall be exempt from taxation now or hereafter imposed by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, but any real property held by the Bank shall be subject to any State, county, municipal, or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed.

* (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of subchapter T of chapter 1 of title 26—

  * (1) the Bank shall be treated as a corporation operating on the cooperative basis within the meaning of section 1381(a)(2) of title 26;

  * (2) the term "patronage dividend", as defined in section 1388(a) of title 26 includes, only as such section applies to the Bank, any patronage refunds in the form of class B or class C stock or allocated surplus that are distributed or set aside by the Bank pursuant to section 3014(i) of this title;

  * (3) the terms "written notice of allocation" and "qualified written notices of allocation", as defined in sections 1388(b) and (c) of title 26, include (to the extent of par value), only as such sections apply to the Bank, any class B or class C stock distributed by the Bank pursuant to section 3014(i) of this title and shall also include any allocated surplus set aside by the Bank pursuant to section 3014(i) of this title;

  * (4) patrons of the Bank shall be deemed to have consented under section 1388(c)(2) of title 26 to the inclusion in their incomes of any qualified written notices of allocation received by such patrons from the Bank; and

  * (5) any amounts required to be included in the incomes of patrons of the Bank with respect to class B or class C stock or allocated surplus shall be treated as earnings from business done by such patrons of the Bank with or for their own patrons.

### §3020. Quarters and space for principal and other offices

Any sums so appropriated shall remain available until expended.

### §3023. Appeal procedures applicable upon denial or restriction of application for assistance
* (a) If an application for assistance under this chapter is denied in whole or in part, the applicant shall be informed within thirty days in writing of the reasons for the denial or restriction.

* (b) Any applicant for assistance under this chapter receiving notice of denial or restriction of the application may, within thirty days of receipt of such notice, request the Board of Directors to review the application and notice of denial or restriction for a determination of whether the action of the Bank was correctly within the terms of this chapter, the regulations, and the policy of the Board. The Board shall consider the request for review at its next meeting and promptly inform the applicant of its determination and the reasons therefor.
