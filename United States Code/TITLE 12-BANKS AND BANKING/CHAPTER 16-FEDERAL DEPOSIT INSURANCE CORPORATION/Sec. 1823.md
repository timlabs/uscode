    * (ii) the total amount of the expenditures by the Corporation and obligations incurred by the Corporation (including any immediate and long-term obligation of the Corporation and any direct or contingent liability for future payment by the Corporation) in connection with the exercise of any such authority with respect to such institution is the least costly to the Deposit Insurance Fund of all possible methods for meeting the Corporation's obligation under this section.

  * (E) DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AVAILABLE FOR INTENDED PURPOSE ONLY.—

    * (i) IN GENERAL.—After December 31, 1994, or at such earlier time as the Corporation determines to be appropriate, the Corporation may not take any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to any insured depository institution that would have the effect of increasing losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by protecting—

* (5) In determining whether to arrange a sale of assets and assumption of liabilities or an acquisition or a merger under the authority of paragraph (2) or (3), the Corporation may solicit such offers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective purchasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of the bank in default or the bank in danger of default.

* (6)(A) If, after receiving offers, the offer presenting the lowest expense to the Corporation, that is in a form and with conditions acceptable to the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "lowest acceptable offer"), is from an offeror that is not an existing in-State bank of the same type as the bank that is in default or is in danger of default (or, where the bank is an insured bank other than a mutual savings bank, the lowest acceptable offer is not from an in-State holding company), the Corporation shall permit the offeror which made the initial lowest acceptable offer and each offeror who made an offer the estimated cost of which to the Corporation was within 15 per centum or $15,000,000, whichever is less, of the initial lowest acceptable offer to submit a new offer.

* (7) No sale may be made under the provisions of paragraph (2) or (3)—

  * (A) which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States;

  * (B) whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Corporation finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transactions are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served; or

  * (C) if in the opinion of the Corporation the acquisition threatens the safety and soundness of the acquirer or does not result in the future viability of the resulting depository institution.

    * (ii) when used in connection with a reference to 2 or more insured banks, insured banks which are subsidiaries of the same holding company; and


  * (D) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning given to such term in section 1841(d) of this title.


* (9) NO ASSISTANCE AUTHORIZED FOR CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF HOLDING COMPANIES.—
