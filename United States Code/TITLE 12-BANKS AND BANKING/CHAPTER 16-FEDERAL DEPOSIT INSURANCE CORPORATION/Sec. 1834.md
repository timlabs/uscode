    * (E) Whether the depositor is permitted to make more than a minimal number of withdrawals from the account each month by any means described in subparagraph (D) or any other means.

    * (F) Whether a monthly statement itemizing all transactions for the monthly reporting period is made available to the depositor with respect to such account or a passbook is provided in which all transactions with respect to such account are recorded.

    * (G) Whether depositors are permitted access to tellers at the institution for conducting transactions with respect to such account.

    * (H) Whether other account relationships with the institution are required in order to open any such account.
