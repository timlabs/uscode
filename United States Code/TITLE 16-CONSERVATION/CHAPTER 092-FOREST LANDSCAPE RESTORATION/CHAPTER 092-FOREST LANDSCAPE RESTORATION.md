### **CHAPTER 92—FOREST LANDSCAPE RESTORATION**

### §7301. Purpose
* The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes through a process that—

  * (1) encourages ecological, economic, and social sustainability;

  * (2) leverages local resources with national and private resources;

  * (3) facilitates the reduction of wildfire management costs, including through reestablishing natural fire regimes and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire; and

    * (A) various ecological restoration techniques—

      * (i) achieve ecological and watershed health objectives; and

      * (ii) affect wildfire activity and management costs; and


    * (B) the use of forest restoration byproducts can offset treatment costs while benefitting local rural economies and improving forest health.

  * (1) be based on a landscape restoration strategy that—

    * (A) is complete or substantially complete;

    * (B) identifies and prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period within a landscape that is—

      * (i) at least 50,000 acres;
