### **CHAPTER 57A—PARTNERSHIPS FOR WILDLIFE**

### §3741. Findings
* The Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Three-fourths of all American children and adults participate in wildlife-related recreational activities other than hunting, fishing and trapping.

  * (2) In 1985, Americans spent over $14 billion on non-consumptive wildlife-related recreation.

  * (3) The United States and Canada are inhabited by approximately two thousand six hundred vertebrate species of native fish and wildlife, which have provided food, clothing, and other essentials to a rapidly expanding human population.

  * (4) Over 80 percent of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in North America are not harvested for human use.

  * (5) The continued well-being of this once-abundant fish and wildlife resource, and even the very existence of many species, is in peril.

  * (6) In 1967, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported that forty-five common migratory bird species, which are not hunted, had exhibited significant declines in abundance, and that thirteen of these species have experienced widespread, systematic declines of 46.9 percent during a twenty-year study period.

  * (7) There have been nationwide declines in frogs and other amphibians.

  * (8) Over two hundred and seventy-five of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in the United States are now officially classified as threatened or endangered by the Federal Government.

  * (9) During the past decade, fish and wildlife species, including invertebrates, were added to the rapidly growing list of threatened and endangered species in North America at the average rate of over one per month.

  * (10) Currently, eighty-two species of invertebrates in the United States are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], and another nine hundred and fifty-one United States invertebrate species are candidates for listing under that Act.

  * (11) Proper management of fish and wildlife, before species become threatened or endangered with extinction, is the key to reversing the increasingly desperate status of fish and wildlife.

  * (12) Proper fish and wildlife conservation includes not only management of fish and wildlife species taken for recreation and protection of endangered and threatened species, but also management of the vast majority of species which fall into neither category.

  * (13) Partnerships in fish and wildlife conservation, such as the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program, the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program, and the North American Wetlands Conservation Act [16 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.] have benefitted greatly the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitats.

  * (14) A program that encourages partnerships among Federal and State governments and private entities to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects would benefit all species of fish and wildlife through such activities as management, research, and interagency coordination.

  * (15) Many States, which are experiencing declining revenues, are finding it increasingly difficult to carry out projects to conserve the entire array of diverse fish and wildlife species and to provide opportunities for the public to associate with, enjoy, and appreciate fish and wildlife through nonconsumptive activities.

### §3742. Purposes
* The purposes of this chapter are to establish a partnership among the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, designated State agencies, and private organizations and individuals—

  * (1) to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects to conserve the entire array of diverse fish and wildlife species in the United States and to provide opportunities for the public to use and enjoy these fish and wildlife species through nonconsumptive activities;

  * (2) to enable designated State agencies to respond more fully and utilize their statutory and administrative authorities by carrying out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects; and

  * (3) to encourage private donations, under the leadership of the States and of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects.

### §3743. Definitions
* As used in this chapter—

  * (1) The terms "conserve" and "conservation" mean to use, and the use of, such methods and procedures which are necessary to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, the well being and enhancement of fish and wildlife and their habitats for the educational, aesthetic, cultural, recreational, scientific, and ecological enrichment of the public. Such methods and procedures may include, but are not limited to, any activity associated with scientific resources management, such as research, census, law enforcement, habitat acquisition, maintenance, development, information, education, population manipulation, propagation, technical assistance to private landowners, live trapping, and transplantation.

  * (2) The term "designated State agency" means the government agency, department, or division of any State that is empowered under the laws of the State to exercise the functions ordinarily exercised by a State fish and wildlife agency.

  * (3) The term "fish and wildlife" means wild members of the animal kingdom that are in an unconfined state.

  * (4) The term "Fund" means the Wildlife Conservation and Appreciation Fund established under section 3744(g) of this title.

  * (5) The term "National Fish and Wildlife Foundation" means the charitable and nonprofit corporation established under section 3701 of this title.

  * (6) The term "nonconsumptive activities" means fish and wildlife associated activities other than harvesting of fish and wildlife and includes, but is not limited to, photographing, observing, learning about, or associating with, fish and wildlife.

  * (7) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

  * (8) The term "State" means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, or American Samoa.

  * (9) The term "wildlife conservation and appreciation project" means a project which is directed toward nonconsumptive activities or toward the conservation of those species of fish and wildlife that—

    * (A) are not ordinarily taken for recreation, fur, or food; except that if under applicable State law, any fish and wildlife may be taken for recreation, fur, or food in some but not all, areas of the State, a wildlife conservation and appreciation project may be directed toward the conservation of any of such fish and wildlife within any area of the State in which such taking is not permitted;

    * (B) are not listed as endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531–1543); and

    * (C) are not marine mammals within the meaning of section 1362(6) of this title.
