Such conservation and rehabilitation programs shall include, but not be limited to, specific habitat improvement projects and related activities and adequate protection for species of fish, wildlife, and plants considered threatened or endangered.

#### (b) Implementation of programs
* The Secretary of the Interior shall implement the conservation and rehabilitation programs required under subsection (a) of this section on public land under his jurisdiction. The Secretary of the Interior shall adopt, modify, and implement the conservation and rehabilitation programs required under such subsection (a) on public land under the jurisdiction of the Chairman, but only with the prior written approval of the Atomic Energy Commission, and on public land under the jurisdiction of the Administrator, but only with the prior written approval of the Administrator. The Secretary of Agriculture shall implement such conservation and rehabilitation programs on public land under his jurisdiction.

### §670h. Comprehensive plans for conservation and rehabilitation programs
#### (a) Development of plans
* (1) The Secretary of the Interior shall develop, in consultation with the State agencies, a comprehensive plan for conservation and rehabilitation programs to be implemented on public land under his jurisdiction and the Secretary of Agriculture shall do the same in connection with public land under his jurisdiction.

* (2) The Secretary of the Interior shall develop, with the prior written approval of the Atomic Energy Commission, a comprehensive plan for conservation and rehabilitation programs to be implemented on public land under the jurisdiction of the Chairman and develop, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, a comprehensive plan for such programs to be implemented on public land under the jurisdiction of the Administrator. Each such plan shall be developed after the Secretary of the Interior makes, with the prior written approval of the Chairman or the Administrator, as the case may be, and in consultation with the State agencies, necessary studies and surveys of the land concerned to determine where conservation and rehabilitation programs are most needed.

#### (b) Consistency with overall land use and management plans; hunting, trapping, and fishing
* Each comprehensive plan developed pursuant to this section shall be consistent with any overall land use and management plans for the lands involved. In any case in which hunting, trapping, or fishing (or any combination thereof) of resident fish and wildlife is to be permitted on public land under a comprehensive plan, such hunting, trapping, and fishing shall be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the State in which such land is located.

* (2) Any conservation and rehabilitation program included within a cooperative agreement entered into under this subsection may be modified in a manner mutually agreeable to the State agency and the Secretary concerned (and the Chairman or the Administrator, as the case may be, if public land under his jurisdiction is involved). Before modifying any cooperative agreement which affects public land under the jurisdiction of the Chairman, the Secretary of the Interior shall obtain the prior written approval of the Atomic Energy Commission and before modifying any cooperative agreement which affects public land under the jurisdiction of the Administrator, the Secretary of the Interior shall obtain the prior written approval of the Administrator.

    * (ii) require the maintenance of accurate records and the filing of annual reports by the State agency to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, or both, as the case may be, setting forth the amount and disposition of the fees collected for such stamps; and

    * (iii) authorize the Secretary concerned and the Comptroller General of the United States, or their authorized representatives, to have access to such records for purposes of audit and examination; and


  * (G) contain such other terms and conditions as the Secretary concerned and the State agency deem necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.


* A cooperative agreement may also provide for arrangements under which the Secretary concerned may authorize officers and employees of the State agency to enforce, or to assist in the enforcement of, section 670j(a) of this title.

* (4) Except where limited under a comprehensive plan or pursuant to cooperative agreement, hunting, fishing, and trapping shall be permitted with respect to resident fish and wildlife in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the State in which such land is located on public land which is the subject of a conservation and rehabilitation program implemented under this subchapter.

* (5) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, shall prescribe such regulations as are deemed necessary to control, in a manner consistent with the applicable comprehensive plan and cooperative agreement, the public use of public land which is the subject of any conservation and rehabilitation program implemented by him under this subchapter.

#### (d) State agency agreements not cooperative agreements under other provisions
* Agreements entered into by State agencies under the authority of this section shall not be deemed to be, or treated as, cooperative agreements to which chapter 63 of title 31 applies.

### §670i. Public land management area stamps for hunting, trapping, and fishing on public lands subject to programs
#### (a) Agreements to require stamps
* Any State agency may agree with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (or with the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, if within the State concerned all conservation and rehabilitation programs under this subchapter will be implemented by him) that no individual will be permitted to hunt, trap, or fish on any public land within the State which is subject to a conservation and rehabilitation program implemented under this subchapter unless at the time such individual is engaged in such activity he has on his person a valid public land management area stamp issued pursuant to this section.

#### (b) Conditions for agreements
* Any agreement made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to require the issuance of public land management area stamps shall be subject to the following conditions:

  * (5) The amount of the fee to be charged for such stamps, the age at which the individual is required to acquire such a stamp, and the expiration date for such stamps shall be mutually agreed upon by the State agency and the Secretary or Secretaries concerned; except that each such stamp shall be void not later than one year after the date of issuance.

  * (6) Each such stamp must be validated by the purchaser thereof by signing his name across the face of the stamp.

  * (7) Any individual to whom a stamp is sold pursuant to this section shall upon request exhibit such stamp for inspection to any officer or employee of the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture, or to any other person who is authorized to enforce section 670j(a) of this title.
