### **CHAPTER 55—COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES**

### §3501. Congressional statement of findings and purpose
* (a) The Congress finds that—

  * (1) coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the shore areas of the Great Lakes of the United States and the adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets and nearshore waters provide—

    * (A) habitats for migratory birds and other wildlife; and

    * (B) habitats which are essential spawning, nursery, nesting, and feeding areas for commercially and recreationally important species of finfish and shellfish, as well as other aquatic organisms such as sea turtles;


  * (2) coastal barriers contain resources of extraordinary scenic, scientific, recreational, natural, historic, archeological, cultural, and economic importance; which are being irretrievably damaged and lost due to development on, among, and adjacent to, such barriers;

  * (3) coastal barriers serve as natural storm protective buffers and are generally unsuitable for development because they are vulnerable to hurricane and other storm damage and because natural shoreline recession and the movement of unstable sediments undermine manmade structures;

  * (4) certain actions and programs of the Federal Government have subsidized and permitted development on coastal barriers and the result has been the loss of barrier resources, threats to human life, health, and property, and the expenditure of millions of tax dollars each year; and

  * (5) a program of coordinated action by Federal, State, and local governments is critical to the more appropriate use and conservation of coastal barriers.


* (b) The Congress declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to minimize the loss of human life, wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources associated with the coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the shore areas of the Great Lakes by restricting future Federal expenditures and financial assistance which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers, by establishing the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System, and by considering the means and measures by which the long-term conservation of these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved.

### §3502. Definitions
* For purposes of this chapter—

  * (1) The term "undeveloped coastal barrier" means—

    * (A) a depositional geologic feature (such as a bay barrier, tombolo, barrier spit, or barrier island) that—

      * (i) is subject to wave, tidal, and wind energies, and

      * (ii) protects landward aquatic habitats from direct wave attack; and


    * (B) all associated aquatic habitats, including the adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets, and nearshore waters;


* but only if such feature and associated habitats contain few manmade structures and these structures, and man's activities on such feature and within such habitats, do not significantly impede geomorphic and ecological processes.

  * (2) The term "Committees" means the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

  * (3) The term "financial assistance" means any form of loan, grant, guaranty, insurance, payment, rebate, subsidy, or any other form of direct or indirect Federal assistance other than—

    * (A) deposit or account insurance for customers of banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, or similar institutions;

    * (B) the purchase of mortgages or loans by the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation;

    * (C) assistance for environmental studies, planning, and assessments that are required incident to the issuance of permits or other authorizations under Federal law; and

    * (D) assistance pursuant to programs entirely unrelated to development, such as any Federal or federally assisted public assistance program or any Federal old-age survivors or disability insurance program.


* Such term includes flood insurance described in section 4028 of title 42.

  * (4) The term "Great Lakes" means Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior, to the extent that those lakes are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

  * (5) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Interior.

  * (6) The term "System" means the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System established by section 3503(a) of this title.

  * (7) The term "System unit" means any undeveloped coastal barrier, or combination of closely-related undeveloped coastal barriers, included within the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System established by section 3503 of this title.

### §3503. Establishment of John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System
#### (a) Establishment
* There is established the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System, which shall consist of those undeveloped coastal barriers and other areas located on the coasts of the United States that are identified and generally depicted on the maps on file with the Secretary entitled "Coastal Barrier Resources System", dated October 24, 1990, as those maps may be replaced, modified, revised, or corrected under—

  * (1) subsection (f)(3);

  * (2) section 4 of the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3503 note; Public Law 101–591); or

  * #### (C) Report
    * No later than 180 days after December 21, 2018, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report regarding the progress and challenges in the transition from paper to digital maps and a timetable for completion of the digitization of all maps related to the System.

#### (c) Boundary review and modification
* At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall review the maps referred to in subsection (a) and shall make, in consultation with the appropriate State, local, and Federal officials, such minor and technical modifications to the boundaries of System units as are necessary solely to reflect changes that have occurred in the size or location of any System unit as a result of natural forces.

#### (d) Additions to System
* The Secretary may add a parcel of real property to the System, if—

  * (1) the owner of the parcel requests, in writing, that the Secretary add the parcel to the System; and
