### **CHAPTER 14A—WHALE CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION**

### §917. Congressional findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) whales are a unique resource of great aesthetic and scientific interest to mankind and are a vital part of the marine ecosystem;

  * (2) whales have been overexploited by man for many years, severely reducing several species and endangering others;

  * (3) the United States has extended its authority and responsibility to conserve and protect all marine mammals, including whales, out to a two hundred nautical mile limit by enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act [16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.];

  * (4) the conservation and protection of certain species of whales, including the California gray, bowhead, sperm, and killer whale, are of particular interest to citizens of the United States;

  * (5) increased ocean activity of all types may threaten the whale stocks found within the two hundred-mile jurisdiction of the United States and added protection of such stocks may be necessary;

  * (6) there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology, habitat, requirements, and population levels and dynamics of all whales found in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and

  * (7) further study of such matters is required in order for the United States to carry out its responsibilities for the conservation and protection of marine mammals.

### §917a. Study by Secretary of Commerce; report to Congress

Such studies shall take into consideration all relevant factors regarding (1) the conservation and protection of all such whales, (2) the distribution, migration patterns, and population dynamics of these mammals, and (3) the effects on all such whales of habitat destruction, disease, pesticides, and other chemicals, disruption of migration patterns, and food shortages for the purpose of developing adequate and effective measures, including appropriate laws and regulations, to conserve and protect such mammals. The Secretary of Commerce shall report on such studies, together with such recommendations as he deems appropriate, including suggested legislation, to the Congress no later than January 1, 1980.
