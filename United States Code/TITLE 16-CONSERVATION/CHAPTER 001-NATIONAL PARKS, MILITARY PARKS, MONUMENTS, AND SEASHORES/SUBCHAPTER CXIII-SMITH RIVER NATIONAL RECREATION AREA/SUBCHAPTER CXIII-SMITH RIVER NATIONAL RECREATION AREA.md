### SUBCHAPTER CXIII—SMITH RIVER NATIONAL RECREATION AREA

### §460bbb. Findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) the Smith River, undammed and free-flowing from its headwaters to the Pacific Ocean, represents one of the last wholly intact vestiges of an invaluable legacy of wild and scenic rivers;

  * (2) the Smith River watershed, from the diverse conifer forests of the Siskiyou Mountains and unique botanical communities of the North Fork serpentine to the ancient redwoods along the river's lower reaches, exhibits a richness of ecological diversity unusual in a basin of its size;

  * (3) the Smith River watershed's scenic beauty, renowned anadromous fisheries, exceptional water quality, and abundant wildlife combine with its ready accessibility to offer exceptional opportunities for a wide range of recreational activities, including wilderness, water sports, fishing, hunting, camping, and sightseeing;

  * (4) careful development and utilization at mutually compatible levels of recreation, fisheries, and timber resources on public lands will ensure the continuation of the Smith River watershed's historic role as a significant contributor to the region's local economy; and

  * (5) protection of the Smith River's unique values can be enhanced by a cooperative effort by Federal, State and local governments to coordinate land-use planning, management, and development of Federal and non-Federal lands throughout the watershed.

* The federally owned lands within the recreation area administered by the Secretary of the Interior on November 16, 1990, comprising approximately 20 acres, are hereby transferred to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture and shall be managed in accordance with the laws applicable to the National Forest System and this subchapter.

### §460bbb–3. Administration
#### (a) In general
* The Secretary shall administer the recreation area in accordance with this subchapter and the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the National Forest System in furtherance of the purposes for which the recreation area was established. In administering the recreation area, the Secretary shall, consistent with the applicable area management emphasis provided under subsection (b), undertake the following:

  * (1) Provide for a broad range of recreation uses and provide recreational and interpretive services and facilities (including trails and campgrounds) for the public.

  * (2) Provide and maintain adequate public access, including vehicular roads for general recreational activities such as camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing.

  * (3) Improve the anadromous fishery and water quality, including (but not limited to) stabilizing landslides, improving fish spawning and rearing habitat, and placing appropriate restrictions or limitations on soil disturbing activities.

  * (4) Permit the use of off-road vehicles only on designated routes.

  * (5) Provide for public health and safety and for the protection of the recreation area in the event of fire or infestation of insects or disease.

  * (6) Permit programmed timber harvest only in those management areas where timber harvest is specifically authorized by subsection (b). Timber management in these areas shall incorporate the use of strategies to reduce habitat fragmentation and employ silvicultural prescriptions designed to maintain or enhance biological diversity and wildlife habitats (such as retention of standing green trees, snags, and other coarse woody debris) by providing for a high level of structural and compositional diversity in managed stands.

  * (7) Permit removal of trees within streamside protection zones along those rivers and river segments specified in section 460bbb–8 of this title only when necessary for human health and safety, to maintain trails or existing roads, for the development of recreation or other facilities, for the protection of the recreation area in the event of fire, or to improve fish and wildlife habitat.

Timber damaged or down in these areas as a result of fire, insects, disease, blowdown or other natural events shall otherwise be retained in its natural condition, with removal permitted only upon a written determination by the Secretary, based upon written findings, that such removal is necessary to provide for or maintain or enhance biological and ecological diversity, without regard for the commodity value of the timber. Such a decision shall not be delegable by the Secretary but shall be subject to administrative appeal and judicial review.

  * (9) Provide for the long-term viability and presence of Port-Orford-cedar and ensure its continued present economic and noneconomic uses through implementation of management strategies developed by the Forest Service.

  * (10) Except where timber harvest is specifically authorized by subsection (b) protect, preserve, and increase old growth forest habitat in the recreation area.

  * (11) Provide for the restoration of landscapes damaged by past human activity consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.

  * (D) The management emphasis for the Upper South Fork management area shall be on wild river and roadless back-country recreation.

  * (E) The management emphasis for the Lower South Fork management area shall be on maintaining and protecting natural scenic values in the river canyon while providing for traditional and compatible river sports, including white water rafting, angling, sightseeing, and developed and dispersed recreation. Timber harvests based on uneven-aged management with extended rotations shall be allowed where consistent with protection of the scenic values of the recreation area.

  * (F) The management emphasis for the Lower Hurdygurdy Creek management area shall be on maintenance of wildlife values while providing rustic family and group recreation facilities for fishing, swimming, hunting, and camping. Timber harvests based on uneven-aged management with extended rotations shall be allowed where consistent with protection of scenic and wildlife values.
