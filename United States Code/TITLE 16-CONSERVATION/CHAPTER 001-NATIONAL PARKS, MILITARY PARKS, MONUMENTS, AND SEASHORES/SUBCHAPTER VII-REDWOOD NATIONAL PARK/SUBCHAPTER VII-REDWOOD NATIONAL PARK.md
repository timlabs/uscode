### SUBCHAPTER VII—REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK

### §79a. Establishment; statement of purposes
* In order to preserve significant examples of the primeval coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forests and the streams and seashores with which they are associated for purposes of public inspiration, enjoyment, and scientific study, there is hereby established a Redwood National Park in Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, California.

### §79b. Park area
#### (a) Boundaries; maps; maximum acreage
* (1) The Redwood National Park consists of the land generally depicted on the map entitled "Redwood National Park, Revised Boundary", numbered 167/60502, and dated February, 2003.

* (2) The map referred to in paragraph (1) shall be—

  * (A) on file and available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of the National Park Service; and

  * (B) provided by the Secretary of the Interior to the appropriate officers of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, California.


* (3) The Secretary; of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") may from time to time, with a view to carrying out the purpose of this subchapter and with particular attention to minimizing siltation of the streams, damage to the timber, and assuring the preservation of the scenery within the boundaries of the national park as depicted on said maps, modify said boundaries, giving notice of any changes involved therein by publication of a revised drawing or boundary description in the Federal Register and by filing said revision with the officers with whom the original maps were filed, but the acreage within said park shall at no time exceed 133,000 acres, exclusive of submerged lands and publicly owned highways and roads.

#### (b) Highways and roads
* The Secretary is authorized to acquire all or part of existing publicly owned highways and roads within the boundaries of the park as he may deem necessary for park purposes. Until such highways and roads have been acquired, the Secretary may cooperate with appropriate State and local officials in patroling and maintaining such roads and highways.

#### (c) Park protection zone
* Within the area outside the boundaries of Redwood National Park indicated as the "Park Protection Zone" on the map entitled "Proposed Additions, Redwood National Park, California", numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, the Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests in land: _Provided_, That lands may be acquired from a willing seller or upon a finding by the Secretary that failure to acquire all or a portion of such lands could result in physical damage to park resources and following notice to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. Any lands so acquired shall be managed in a manner which will maximize the protection of the resources of Redwood National Park, and in accordance with the Act of October 21, 1976 (90 Stat. 2743) [43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.]. Acquisition of a parcel of land under the authority of this subsection shall not as a result of such acquisition diminish the right of owners of adjacent lands to the peaceful use and enjoyment of their land and shall not confer authority upon the Secretary to acquire additional lands except as provided in this subsection.

### §79c. Acquisition of land
#### (a) Authority of Secretary; administrative sites; manner and place; donation of State lands; reverters and other conditions
* The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests in land within the boundaries of the Redwood National Park and, in addition thereto, not more than ten acres outside of those boundaries for an administrative site or sites. Such acquisition may be by donation, purchase with appropriated or donated funds, exchange, or otherwise, but lands and interests in land owned by the State of California may be acquired only by donation which donation of lands or interest in lands may be accepted in the discretion of the Secretary subject to such preexisting reverters and other conditions as may appear in the title to these lands held by the State of California, and such other reverters and conditions as may be consistent with the use and management of the donated lands as a portion of Redwood National Park. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may expend appropriated funds for the management of and for the construction, design, and maintenance of permanent improvements on such lands and interests in land as are donated by the State of California in a manner not inconsistent with such reverters and other conditions.

#### (b) Vested and possessory rights in certain real property; termination of operations; removal of equipment, facilities, and personal property; down tree personal property; acquired roads; just compensation; payment; jurisdiction; acreage limitation; notice
* (1) Effective on October 2, 1968, there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the park boundaries designated in maps NPS–RED–7114–A and NPS–RED–7114–B and effective on March 27, 1978, there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the area indicated as "Proposed Additions" on the map entitled "Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California," numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, and all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of the down tree personal property (trees severed from the ground by man) severed prior to January 1, 1975, or subsequent to January 31, 1978, within the area indicated as "Proposed Additions" on the map entitled "Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California," numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, except real property owned by the State of California or a political subdivision thereof and except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The Secretary shall allow for the orderly termination of all operations on real property acquired by the United States under this subsection, and for the removal of equipment, facilities, and personal property therefrom.

* Down tree personal property severed subsequent to December 31, 1974, and prior to February 1, 1978 may be removed in accordance with applicable State and Federal law, or other applicable licenses, permits, and existing agreements, unless the Secretary determines that the removal of such down timber would damage second growth resources or result in excessive sedimentation in Redwood Creek: _Provided, however_, That down timber lying in stream beds may not be removed without permission of the Secretary: _Provided_, That such removal shall also be subject to such reasonable conditions as may be required by the Secretary to insure the continued availability of raw materials to Redwoods United, Incorporated, a nonprofit corporation located in Manila, California.

* The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of each acquired segment of the B line, L line, M line, and K and K roads by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: _Provided_, That such use is limited to forest and land management and protection purposes, including timber harvesting and road maintenance. The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of acquired portions of the Bald Hills road by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: _Provided further_, That nothing in this sentence shall diminish the authority of the Secretary to otherwise regulate the use of the Bald Hills road.

* (2) The United States will pay just compensation to the owner of any real property taken by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such compensation shall be paid either: (A) by the Secretary of the Treasury from money appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, including money appropriated to the Fund pursuant to section 4(b) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, as amended, subject to the appropriation limitation in section 79j of this title, upon certification to him by the Secretary of the agreed negotiated value of such property, or the valuation of the property awarded by judgment, including interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of taking the property to the date of payment therefor; or (B) by the Secretary, if the owner of the land concurs, with any federally owned property available to him for purposes of exchange pursuant to the provisions of section 79e of this title; or (C) by the Secretary using any combination of such money or federally owned property. Any action against the United States with regard to the provisions of this subchapter and for the recovery of just compensation for the lands and interests therein taken by the United States, and for the down tree personal property taken, shall be brought in the United States district court for the district where the land is located without regard to the amount claimed. The United States may initiate proceedings at any time seeking a determination of just compensation in the district court in the manner provided by sections 1358 and 1403 of title 28 and may deposit in the registry of the court the estimated just compensation, or a part thereof, in accordance with the procedure generally described by section 3114(a)–(d) of title 40. Interest shall not be allowed on such amounts as shall have been paid into the court. In the event that the Secretary determines that the fee simple title to any property (real or personal) taken under this section is not necessary for the purposes of this subchapter, he may, with particular attention to minimizing the payment of severance damages and to allow for the orderly removal of down timber, revest title to such property subject to such reservations, terms, and conditions, if any, as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, and may compensate the former owner for no more than the fair market value of the rights so reserved, except that the Secretary may not revest title to any property for which just compensation has been paid; or, the Secretary may sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41 such down timber as in his judgment may be removed without damage to the park, the proceeds from such sales being credited to the Treasury of the United States. If the State of California designates a right-of-way for a bypass highway around the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park prior to October 1, 1984, the Secretary is authorized and directed to acquire such lands or interests in lands as may be necessary for such a highway and, subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine are necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park, shall thereupon donate the designated right-of-way to the State of California for a new bypass highway from a point south of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park through the drainage of May Creek and Boyes Creek to extend along the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park within Humboldt County. Such acreage as may be necessary in the judgment of the Secretary for this conveyance, and for a buffer thereof, shall be deemed to be a publicly owned highway for purposes of section 79b(a) of this title effective on March 27, 1978.

* (3) This subsection shall apply to ownerships of fifty acres or less only if such ownerships are held or occupied primarily for nonresidential or nonagricultural purposes, and if the Secretary gives notice to the owner within sixty days after October 2, 1968, of the application of this subsection. Notice by the Secretary shall be deemed to have been made as of October 2, 1968. The district court of the United States for that district in which such ownerships are located shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action brought by any person having an interest therein for damages occurring by reason of the temporary application of this paragraph, between October 2, 1968, and the date upon which the Secretary gives such notice. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (c) of this section to acquire such areas for the purposes of this subchapter.

#### (c) Minimization of severance damages; costs not chargeable against appropriations authorization
* If any individual tract or parcel of land acquired is partly inside and partly outside the boundaries of the park or the administrative site the Secretary may, in order to minimize the payment of severance damages, acquire the whole of the tract or parcel and exchange that part of it which is outside the boundaries for land or interests in land inside the boundaries or for other land or interests in land acquired pursuant to this subchapter, and dispose of so much thereof as is not so utilized in accordance with the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41. The cost of any land so acquired and disposed of shall not be charged against the limitation on authorized appropriations contained in section 79j of this title.

#### (d) Lands for screen of trees along certain highway
* The Secretary is further authorized to acquire, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, lands and interests in land bordering both sides of the highway between the present southern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park and a point on Redwood Creek near the town of Orick to a depth sufficient to maintain or to restore a screen of trees between the highway and the land behind the screen and the activities conducted thereon.

#### (e) Timber, soil, and stream protection; "interests in land" defined; notice to Congress of intended action, costs, and benefits requisite for acquisitions, contracts, or cooperative agreements; availability of funds; authorization of appropriations; rehabilitative activities
* In order to afford as full protection as is reasonably possible to the timber, soil, and streams within the boundaries of the park, the Secretary is authorized, by any of the means set out in subsections (a) and (c) of this section, to acquire interests in land from, and to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, the owners of land on the periphery of the park and on watersheds tributary to streams within the park designed to assure that the consequences of forestry management, timbering, land use, and soil conservation practices conducted thereon, or of the lack of such practices, will not adversely affect the timber, soil, and streams within the park as aforesaid. As used in this subsection, the term "interests in land" does not include fee title unless the Secretary finds that the cost of a necessary less-than-fee interest would be disproportionately high as compared with the estimated cost of the fee. No acquisition other than by donation shall be effectuated and no contract or cooperative agreement shall be executed by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this subsection until after he has notified the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his intended action and of the costs and benefits to the United States involved therein. Effective on March 27, 1978, there are made available from the amounts provided in section 79j of this title or as may be hereafter provided such sums as may be necessary for the acquisition of interests in land. Effective on October 1, 1978, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the implementation of contracts and cooperative agreements pursuant to this subsection: _Provided_, That it is the express intent of Congress that the Secretary shall to the greatest degree possible insure that such contracts and cooperative agreements provide for the maximum retention of senior employees by such owners and for their utilization in rehabilitation and other efforts. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, is further authorized, pursuant to contract or cooperative agreement with agencies of the Federal Executive, the State of California, any political or governmental subdivision thereof, any corporation, not-for-profit corporation, private entity or person, to initiate, provide funds, equipment, and personnel for the development and implementation of a program for the rehabilitation of areas within and upstream from the park contributing significant sedimentation because of past logging disturbances and road conditions, and, to the extent feasible, to reduce risk of damage to streamside areas adjacent to Redwood Creek and for other reasons: _Provided further_, That authority to make payments under this subsection shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such contracts or cooperative agreements shall be subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may determine necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park generally, and to provide employment opportunities to those individuals affected by this taking and to contribute to the economic revival of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties in northern California. The Secretary shall undertake and publish studies on erosion and sedimentation originating within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek with particular effort to identify sources and causes, including differentiation between natural and man-aggravated conditions, and shall adapt his general management plan to benefit from the results of such studies. The Secretary, or the Secretary of Agriculture, where appropriate, shall also manage any additional Federal lands under his jurisdiction that are within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek in a manner which will minimize sedimentation which could affect the park, and in coordination with plans for sediment management within the basin. To effectuate the provisions of this subsection, and to further develop scientific and professional information and data concerning the Redwood Forest ecosystem, and the various factors that may affect it, the Secretary may authorize access to the area subject to this subsection by designated representatives of the United States.

### §79c–1. Vesting in United States of all right, title, etc., in real property and down tree personal property in additional lands; effective date; authorization of appropriations
* Notwithstanding any provision of the Act of October 2, 1968 [16 U.S.C. 79a et seq.], the vesting in the United States of all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property and all down tree personal property within the area indicated as "Proposed Additions" on the map entitled "Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California," numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, as established by section 79c(b)(1) of this title, shall be effective on March 27, 1978. The provisions of section 79c(b)(3) of this title shall also relate to the effective date of this section. From the appropriations authorized for fiscal year 1978 and succeeding fiscal years such sums as may be necessary may be expended for the acquisition of lands and interests in lands, and down tree personal property, authorized to be acquired, or acquired, pursuant to the provisions of this Act.

### §79d. Acquisition of lands
#### (a) Owner's retention of right of use and occupancy for noncommercial residential purposes for fixed term of years or for life; election of term; fair market value; termination of use and occupancy inconsistent with stated purpose and upon payment of sum for unexpired right
* The owner of improved property on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary under this subchapter may, as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself and his heirs and assigns a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for noncommercial residential purposes for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated to the United States, the Secretary shall pay the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of acquisition minus the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that it is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of this subchapter, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon the Secretary's notifying the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him an amount equal to the fair market value of that portion of the right which remains unexpired.

#### (b) "Improved property" defined
* The term "improved property", as used in this section, means a detached, noncommercial residential dwelling, the construction of which was begun before October 9, 1967, together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, the said land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures accessory to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated.

#### (c) Sale or lease of certain realty to former owner; conditions and restrictions
* The Secretary shall have, with respect to any real property acquired by him in sections 5 and 8, township 13 north, range 1 east, Humboldt meridian, authority to sell or lease the same to the former owner under such conditions and restrictions as will assure that it is not utilized in a manner or for purposes inconsistent with the national park.

### §79e. Exchange of property; cash equalization payments; commercial operations, minimum economic dislocation and disruption
* In exercising his authority to acquire property by exchange, the Secretary may accept title to any non-Federal property within the boundaries of the park, and outside of such boundaries within the limits prescribed in this subchapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may acquire such property from the grantor by exchange for any federally owned property under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in California, except property needed for public use and management, which he classifies as suitable for exchange or other disposal, or any federally owned property he may designate within the Northern Redwood Purchase Unit in Del Norte County, California, except that section known and designated as the Yurok Experimental Forest, consisting of approximately nine hundred and thirty-five acres. Such federally owned property shall also be available for use by the Secretary in lieu of, or together with, cash in payment of just compensation for any real property taken pursuant to section 79c(b) of this title. The values of the properties so exchanged either shall be approximately equal or, if they are not approximately equal, the value shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the grantor or to the Secretary as the circumstances require. Through the exercise of his exchange authority, the Secretary shall, to the extent possible, minimize economic dislocation and the disruption of the grantor's commercial operations.

### §79f. Transfer of property from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within any of the areas described in sections 79b and 79c of this title may, with the concurrence of the head of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for use by him in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter.

### §79g. Contract authorization within prescribed cost limits; installments: duration, interest; provisions for payment of judgments and compromise settlements applicable to judgments against United States
* (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to contracts for the acquisition of land and interests in land for the purposes of this subchapter as was given the Secretary of the Treasury for other land acquisitions by section 3171 of title 40, and the Secretary and the owner of land to be acquired under this subchapter may agree that the purchase price will be paid in periodic installments over a period that does not exceed ten years, with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at a rate which is not in excess of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on the installments.

* (b) Judgments against the United States, including final partial judgments and compromise settlements of claims referred to the Attorney General for defense of suits against the United States, for amounts in excess of the deposit in court in actions under section 79c of this title shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of section 1304 of title 31, and section 2414 of title 28. Final partial judgments and compromise settlements are payable only after certification by the Attorney General to the Comptroller General that it is in the interest of the United States to do so.

* (a) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, shall conduct an analysis of appropriate Federal actions that may be necessary or desirable to mitigate any adverse economic impacts to public and private segments of the local economy, other than the owners of properties taken by this Act, as a result of the addition of property to Redwood National Park under sections 79b and 79c of this title. The Secretaries shall also consider the benefits of making grants or entering into contracts or cooperative agreements with the State of California or Del Norte and Humboldt Counties as provided by subsection (b) for the purpose of development and implementation of a program of forest resource improvement and utilization, including, but not limited to, reforestation, erosion control, and other forest land conservation measures, fisheries and fish and wildlife habitat improvements, and wood energy facilities. Not later than January 1, 1979, the Secretary shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate a report of his analysis, including his recommendations with respect to actions that should be taken to mitigate any significant short-term and long-term adverse effects on the local economy caused by such addition.

* (b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary, and pursuant to his study, shall apply such existing programs as are necessary and appropriate to further mitigate identified employment and other adverse economic impacts on public and private segments of the local economy, other than with regard to the payment of just compensation to the owners of properties taken by this Act and by the Act of October 2, 1968 [16 U.S.C. 79a et seq.]. In addition to the land rehabilitation and employment provisions of this Act, which should have a substantial positive economic effect on the local economy, the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor are further authorized and directed to implement existing authorities to establish employment programs, pursuant to such grants, contracts and cooperative agreements with agencies of the Federal Executive, the State of California, any political or governmental subdivision thereof, any corporation, not-for-profit corporation, private entity or person, for the development and implementation of such programs, as, in the discretion of the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, may be necessary to provide employment opportunities to those individuals affected by this taking and to contribute to the economic revival of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, in northern California. Effective on October 1, 1978, there are authorized such sums as may be necessary to carry out the employment and economic mitigation provisions of this Act: _Provided_, That the authority to make payments under this section shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

#### (b) Appointment and compensation of personnel for administration of expanded Park; appointment, etc., of additional personnel
* In order to effectively administer the expanded Redwood National Park created by this Act in a manner that will provide maximum protection to its resources and to provide for maximum visitor use and enjoyment to ease the local economic effects of this taking, the Secretary shall have power to appoint and fix the compensation of two full-time and twenty temporary employees in the competitive service. The Secretary shall further have power to appoint and fix the compensation of an additional thirty-two full-time and forty temporary employees in the competitive service as provided by this subsection at the time of the donation of those park lands or interests in land owned by the State of California as are within the boundaries of Redwood National Park as provided herein.

#### (d) Procedures applicable to Federal agencies for creating or filling job positions; applicants subject to preferential treatment; considerations for employment
* (1) Any Federal agency that is creating or filling a civilian Federal job that is within the scope of clause (2)(A) of this subsection, pursuant to contract, civil service merit system, or otherwise, that will be primarily located in Humboldt or Del Norte Counties, California, or other counties in California adjacent thereto, must provide notice in advance of the availability of that job and must provide qualified affected employee applicants for these positions with full consideration for these positions if the further conditions set forth in clause (2)(B) of this subsection are met. The notice required by this paragraph shall be as provided by applicable law and regulation through the offices of the Employment and Training Services located in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties, California, and through such other means as are likely to gain the attention of affected employees.

* (2) Consideration for employment under this section shall be provided under the following conditions:

  * (A) the job involves skills and training that could reasonably be expected to have been gained by individuals who have been employed as logging and related woods employees or sawmill, plywood, and other wood processing employees, or office employees, or that can reasonably be expected to be gained while so employed, or pursuant to retraining as provided herein; and

  * (B) the applicant has the ability, or can reasonably be expected to have the ability after appropriate training of reasonable duration as further provided herein, to perform the duties of the job: _Provided_, That the full consideration shall not be required with respect to those affected employee applicants requiring training in a situation where the schedule for completion of the work is such that the period during which said employee can reasonably be expected to work following completion of training is determined by the Secretary to be incommensurate with the time and funds required to provide said employee with the necessary training.

#### (e) Private employer requirements for filling covered employment positions with affected employees pursuant to Federal contracts, etc.; procedures applicable and considerations for employment

If the job is one which must be filled while the affected employee would be in training, the Secretary shall encourage the employer to fill the job only on a temporary basis subject to the successful completion of the training by the affected employee;

  * (C) shall require that, in a case in which two or more affected employee applicants have approximately equal qualifications for a job for which they are to receive full consideration, that applicant with the greatest creditable service shall be given preference among those applicants entitled to full consideration; and
