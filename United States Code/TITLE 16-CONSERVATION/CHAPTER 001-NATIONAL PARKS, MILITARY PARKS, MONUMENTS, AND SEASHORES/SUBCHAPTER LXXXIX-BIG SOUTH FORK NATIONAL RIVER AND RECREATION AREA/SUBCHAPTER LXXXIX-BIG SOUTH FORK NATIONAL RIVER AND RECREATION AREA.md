### §460ee. Establishment
#### (a) "Secretary" defined; statement of purposes; boundaries; acquisition of outside sites for administrative, visitor orientation, and recreation facilities
* As used in this section the term "Secretary" shall mean the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers. The Secretary, in accordance with the national recreation area concept included in the interagency report prepared pursuant to section 218 of the Flood Control Act of 1968 (Public Law 90–483) by the Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture, as modified by this section, is authorized and directed to establish on the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River in Kentucky and Tennessee the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area (hereafter in this section referred to as the "National Area") for the purposes of conserving and interpreting an area containing unique cultural, historic, geologic, fish and wildlife, archeologic, scenic, and recreational values, preserving as a natural, free-flowing stream the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, major portions of its Clear Fork and New River stems, and portions of their various tributaries for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations, the preservation of the natural integrity of the scenic gorges and valleys, and the development of the area's potential for healthful outdoor recreation. The boundaries shall be as generally depicted on the drawing prepared by the Corps of Engineers and entitled "Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area" identified as map number BSF–NRRA(1)(A) and dated October 1972, which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District, Nashville, Tennessee. The Secretary may acquire sites at locations outside such boundaries, as he determines necessary, for administrative and visitor orientation facilities. The Secretary may also acquire a site outside such boundaries at or near the location of the historic Tabard Inn in Ruby, Tennessee, including such lands as he deems necessary, for the establishment of a lodge with recreational facilities as provided in subsection (e)(3).

#### (b) Transfer of responsibility for planning, acquisition, and development, and administrative jurisdiction to Secretary of the Interior; boundary revisions; acreage limitation
* Effective upon November 15, 1990, responsibility for all planning, acquisition, and development, as well as administrative jurisdiction over all Federal lands, water, interests therein, and improvements thereon, within the National Area is hereby transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary may complete all acquisition and development activities in progress on November 15, 1990, and the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior may, by mutual agreement, provide for an orderly and phased assumption of responsibilities (including but not limited to land acquisition and the construction of necessary access roads, day-use facilities, campground facilities, lodges, and administrative buildings) and available funds by the Secretary of the Interior in furtherance of the purposes of this section. The Secretary of the Interior shall administer the National Area in accordance with the provisions of the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1, 2–4), as amended and supplemented. The authorities set forth in this section which were available to the Secretary immediately prior to November 15, 1990, shall after November 15, 1990, be available to the Secretary of the Interior. In the administration of the National Area the Secretary may utilize such statutory authority available to him for the conservation and management of wildlife and natural resources as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section. The Secretary of the Interior may, after transfer to him, revise the boundaries from time to time, but the total acreage within such boundaries shall not exceed one hundred and twenty-five thousand acres. Following such transfer the authorities available to the Secretary in subsection (c) of this section shall likewise be available to the Secretary of the Interior.

#### (c) Acquisition of property; tracts; exchange and disposal of property; transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary; residential property, right of use and occupancy; fair market value; transfer or assignment; lifetime residence of tenant or spouse; accrual of obligation or rental to United States; "improved property" defined; mineral rights
* (1) Within the boundaries of the National Area, the Secretary may acquire lands and waters or interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange or otherwise, except that lands (other than roads and rights-of-way for roads) owned by the States of Kentucky and Tennessee or any political subdivisions thereof which were in public ownership on October 22, 1976, may be acquired only by donation. When an individual tract of land is only partly within the boundaries of the National Area, the Secretary may acquire all of the tract by any of the above methods in order to avoid the payment of severance costs. Land so acquired outside of the boundaries of the National Area may be exchanged by the Secretary for non-Federal lands within the National Area boundaries, and any portion of the land not utilized for such exchanges may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property within the boundaries of the National Area shall be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of this section.

* (2) With the exception of property or any interest in property that the Secretary determines is necessary for purposes of administration, preservation, or public use, any owner or owners (hereafter in this section referred to as "owner") of improved property used solely for noncommercial residential purposes on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may retain the right of use and occupancy of such property for such purposes for a term, as the owner may elect, ending either (A) upon the death of the owner or his spouse, whichever occurs later, or (B) not more than twenty-five years from the date of acquisition. The Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value on such date of the term retained by the owner. Such right: shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate to assure that the property is used in accordance with the purposes of this section; may be transferred or assigned; and may be terminated with respect to the entire property by the Secretary upon his determination that the property or any portion thereof has ceased to be used for noncommercial residential purposes, and upon tender to the holder of the right an amount equal to the fair market value, as of the date of the tender, of that portion of the right which remains unexpired on the date of termination. Any person residing upon improved property, subject to the right of acquisition by the Secretary as a tenant or by the sufferance of the owner or owners of the property may be allowed to continue in such residence for the lifetime of such person or his spouse, whichever occurs later, subject to the same restrictions as applicable to owners residing upon such property and provided that any obligation or rental incurred as consideration for such tenancy shall accrue during such term to the United States to be used in the administration of this section.

* (3) As used in this section the term "improved property" means a detached year-round one-family dwelling which serves as the owner's permanent place of abode at the time of acquisition, and construction of which was begun before January 1, 1974, together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, such land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, except that the Secretary may exclude from any improved property any waters or land fronting thereon, together with so much of the land adjoining such waters or land as he deems necessary for public access thereto.

* (4) In any case where the Secretary determines that underlying minerals are removable consistent with the provisions of subsection (e)(3) of this section, the owner of the minerals underlying property acquired for the purposes of this section may retain such interest. The Secretary shall reserve the right to inspect and regulate the extraction of such minerals to insure that the values enumerated in subsection (a) are not reduced and that the purposes declared in subsection (e)(1) are not interfered with.

#### (d) Hunting, fishing, and trapping; rules and regulations after consultations with State agencies
* The Secretary, and the Secretary of the Interior after jurisdiction over the National Area has been transferred to him under subsection (b) of this section, shall permit hunting, fishing, and trapping on lands and waters under his jurisdiction within the boundaries of the National Area in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, except that he may designate zones where, and establish periods when, no hunting, fishing, or trapping shall be permitted for reasons of public safety, administration, fish or wildlife management, or public use and enjoyment. Except in emergencies, any rules and regulations of the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to this subsection shall be put into effect only after consultation with the appropriate State agency responsible for hunting, fishing, and trapping activities.
