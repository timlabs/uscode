### SUBCHAPTER XVI—CESSION OF INDIAN LANDS AT SULPHUR, OKLAHOMA

### §151. Acquisition; payment
* The Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes absolutely and unqualifiedly relinquish, cede, and convey unto the United States a tract or tracts of land at and in the vicinity of the village of Sulphur, in the Chickasaw Nation, of not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, to be selected, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and to embrace all the natural springs in and about said village, and so much of Sulphur Creek, Rock Creek, Buckhorn Creek, and the lands adjacent to said natural springs and creeks as may be deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior for the proper utilization and control of said springs and the waters of said creeks, which lands shall be so selected as to cause the least interference with the contemplated town site at that place consistent with the purposes for which said cession is made. The ceded lands shall be held, owned, and controlled by the United States absolutely and without any restriction, save that no part thereof shall be platted or disposed of for town-site purposes during the existence of the two tribal governments. There shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of the two tribes, from the unappropriated public moneys of the United States, $20 per acre for each acre so selected, which shall be in full compensation for the lands so ceded, and such moneys shall, upon the dissolution of the tribal governments, be divided per capita among the members of the tribes, freedmen excepted, as are other funds of the tribes. Until otherwise provided by law, the Secretary of the Interior may, under rules prescribed for that purpose, regulate and control the use of the water of said springs and creeks and the temporary use and occupation of the lands so ceded. No person shall occupy any portion of the lands so ceded, or carry on any business thereon, except as provided in said rules, and until otherwise provided by Congress the laws of the United States relating to the introduction, possession, sale, and giving away of liquors or intoxicants of any kind within the Indian country or Indian reservations shall be applicable to the lands so ceded. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or held to commit the Government of the United States to any expenditure of money upon said lands or the improvements thereof, except as provided herein, it being the intention of this provision that in the future the lands and improvements herein mentioned shall be conveyed by the United States to such Territorial or State organization as may exist at the time when such conveyance is made.

### §152. Additional land withdrawn; payment; management and control; regulations; sale of improvements; penalties; town lots
* The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to withhold from sale or other disposition the irregular tract of land containing seventy-eight and sixty-eight one-hundredths acres, more or less, lying in the northwest quarter of section 2 and the northeast quarter of section 3, township 1 south, range 3 east, and being within the exterior boundaries of the proposed town site of Sulphur, in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, and excluded from said town site by order of the Secretary of the Interior, of October 20, 1903, and also to withdraw and withhold from disposition the tract of land within the exterior boundaries of said proposed town site, lying south of and adjacent to the tract above mentioned, containing in the aggregate one hundred and thirty-eight acres, more or less, and mentioned in the report of Gerard H. Matthes, of December 27, 1903, to F. H. Newell, chief engineer United States Geological Survey, and shown upon the map accompanying said report by a yellow line.

* The land reserved shall be paid for by the United States at the rate of $60 per acre and in the same manner as the land acquired in accordance with the provisions of section 151 of this title and shall be a part of the reservation established at the village of Sulphur, subject to all the provisions of said section 151, respecting the care, control, direction, use, and occupancy thereof as if they had been included in the original segregation. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in the absence of other provisions for the care and management thereof, to designate an officer or employee of his department to take charge of the land, acquired under this section and section 151 of this title, and to enforce rules and regulations for the control and use thereof, and of the waters of the springs and creeks within the reservation. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his discretion, to sell or dispose of any buildings upon the land reserved, and all money received from such sales, or that may be realized for the use of said waters or for the use and occupancy of the land or the buildings thereon, through leases, permits, or otherwise, shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of miscellaneous receipts. If any person, firm, or corporation shall willfully violate any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior relative to the use of the waters of said springs and creeks and the use and occupation of the lands in said reservation, such person, firm, corporation, or members or agents thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than $5 and not more than $100, and may be imprisoned for a term of not more than six months for each offense.

### §153. Existing laws unaffected by admission of Oklahoma; rights and jurisdiction of United States; indemnity school lands
* Nothing in the Act of June 16, 1906, chapter 3335, Thirty-fourth Statutes, page 267, entitled, "An Act to enable the people of Oklahoma and of the Indian Territory to form a constitution and State government and be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States \*&nbsp;\*&nbsp;\*", shall repeal or affect any Act of Congress relating to the Sulphur Springs Reservation as defined on June 16, 1906, or as may be thereafter defined or extended, or the power of the United States over it or any other lands embraced in the State hereafter set aside by Congress as a national park, game preserve, or for the preservation of objects of archaeological or ethnological interest; and nothing contained in said Act shall interfere with the rights and ownership of the United States in any land hereafter set aside by Congress as national park, game preserve, or other reservation, or in the said Sulphur Springs Reservation, as it was on June 16, 1906, or may be defined or extended by law; but exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, shall be exercised by the United States, which shall have exclusive control and jurisdiction over the same; but nothing in this section contained shall be construed to prevent the service within said Sulphur Springs Reservation or national parks, game preserves, and other reservations hereafter established by law, of civil and criminal processes lawfully issued by the authority of said State, and said State shall not be entitled to select indemnity school lands for the thirteenth, sixteenth, thirty-third, and thirty-sixth sections that may be embraced within the metes and bounds of the national park, game preserve, and other reservation or the said Sulphur Springs Reservation, as defined on June 16, 1906, or may be thereafter defined.
