#### (c) Description; boundary revisions: notice to Congressional committees, publication in Federal Register; acquisition of property: manner, transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary, exchange of lands with city of Los Angeles, development of municipal cultural resource management program; Nike Site transfer to Secretary
* (1) The recreation area shall consist of the lands and waters and interests generally depicted as the recreation area on the map entitled "Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Santa Monica Mountains Zone, California, Boundary Map", numbered 80,047–C and dated August 2001, which shall be on file and available for inspection in the offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, and in the offices of the General Services Administration in the Federal Office Building in West Los Angeles, California, and in the main public library in Ventura, California. After advising the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate, in writing, the Secretary may make minor revisions of the boundaries of the recreation area when necessary by publication of a revised drawing or other boundary description in the Federal Register.

* (2)(A) Not later than ninety days after November 10, 1978, the Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of the State of California, the California Coastal Commission, and the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission, shall commence acquisition of lands, improvements, waters, or interests therein within the recreation area. Such acquisition may be by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer from any Federal agency, exchange, or otherwise. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any lands or interests therein owned by the State of California or any political subdivision thereof (including any park district or other public entity) may be acquired only by donation, except that such lands acquired after November 10, 1978, by the State of California or its political subdivisions may be acquired by purchase or exchange if the Secretary determines that the lands were acquired for purposes which further the national interest in protecting the area and that the purchase price or value on exchange does not exceed fair market value on the date that the State acquired the land or interest: _Provided, however_, That the value of any lands acquired by the Secretary under the exception in this sentence shall be deducted from the amount of moneys available for grants to the State under subsection (n) of this section. Lands within the "Wildlife Corridor Expansion Zone" identified on the boundary map referred to in paragraph (1) may be acquired only by donation or with donated funds. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within the boundaries of the recreation area shall, with the concurrence of the head of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without cost, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of the recreation area.

* (B) The Secretary shall negotiate, and carry out, and exchange with the city of Los Angeles (acting through its department of water and power) certain federally owned lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir in Inyo County for certain lands owned by the city of Los Angeles which are associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir in the city of Los Angeles. Lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to such exchange shall be transferred without cost to the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service for inclusion within the recreation area. The Secretary shall include in such exchange a provision for an easement to be granted to the city of Los Angeles for the existing water pipeline associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir and for the city of Los Angeles to provide for replacement water to maintain the water elevations of the Franklin Reservoir to the current levels. The values of lands exchanged under this provision shall be equal, or shall be equalized, in the same manner as provided in section 1716 of title 43.

* (C) The city shall assume full responsibility for the protection of cultural resources and shall develop a cultural resource management program for the public lands to be transferred to the city in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir. The program shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the California State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

* (3) The Administrator of the General Services Administration is hereby authorized and directed to transfer the site generally known as Nike Site 78 to the Secretary for inclusion in the recreation area: _Provided_, That the county of Los Angeles shall be permitted to continue to use without charge the facilities together with sufficient land as in the determination of the Secretary shall be necessary to continue to maintain and operate a fire suppression and training facility and shall be excused from payment for any use of the land and facilities on the site prior to November 10, 1978. At such time as the county of Los Angeles, California, relinquishes control of such facilities and adjacent land or ceases the operation of the fire suppression and training facility, the land and facilities shall be managed by the Secretary as a part of the recreation area.

#### (d) Identification and revision of areas: public ownership for critical purposes; land and area plan: submission to Congressional committees
* (1) Within six months after November 10, 1978, the Secretary shall identify the lands, waters, and interests within the recreation area which must be acquired and held in public ownership for the following critical purposes: preservation of beaches and coastal uplands; protection of undeveloped inland stream drainage basins; connection of existing State and local government parks and other publicly owned lands to enhance their potential for public recreation use; protection of existing park roads and scenic corridors, including such right-of-way as is necessary for the protection of the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Corridor; protection of the public health and welfare; and development and interpretation of historic sites and recreation areas in connection therewith, to include, but not be limited to, parks, picnic areas, scenic overlooks, hiking trails, bicycle trails, and equestrian trails. The Secretary may from time to time revise the identification of such areas, and any such revisions shall become effective in the same manner as herein provided for revisions in the boundaries of the recreation area.

* (2) By January 1, 1980, the Secretary shall submit, in writing, to the committees referred to in subsection (c) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the United States Congress a detailed plan which shall indicate—

  * (A) the lands and areas identified in paragraph (1),

  * (B) the lands which he has previously acquired by purchase, donation, exchange, or transfer for the purpose of this recreation area,

  * (C) the annual acquisition program (including the level of funding) recommended for the ensuing five fiscal years, and

  * (D) the final boundary map for the recreation area.

#### (e) Improved property and scenic easement acquisitions
* With respect to improved properties, as defined in this section, fee title shall not be acquired unless the Secretary finds that such lands are being used, or are threatened with uses, which are detrimental to the purposes of the recreation area, or unless each acquisition is necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. The Secretary may acquire scenic easements to such improved property or such other interests as, in his judgment are necessary for the purposes of the recreation area.

#### (f) "Improved property" defined
* For the purposes of this section, the term "improved property" means—

  * (1) a detached single-family dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1978 (hereafter referred to as "dwelling"), together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated as is in the same ownership as the dwelling and as the Secretary designates to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures necessary to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated, and

  * (2) property developed for agricultural uses, together with any structures accessory thereto as were used for agricultural purposes on or before January 1, 1978.


* In determining when and to what extent a property is to be treated as "improved property" for purposes of this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1978, and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed prior to such date.

#### (g) Owner's reservation of right of use and occupancy for fixed term of years or life; election of term; fair market value; termination; notification
* The owner of an improved property, as defined in this section, on the date of its acquisition, as a condition of such acquisition, may retain for herself or himself, her or his heirs and assigns, a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for noncommercial residential or agriculture purposes, as the case may be, for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of her or his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained by the owner pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that it is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this section, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.

#### (h) Hardship sale offers
* In exercising the authority to acquire property under this section, the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by an individual owning property within the recreation area to sell such property, if such individual notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.

#### (i) Administration

The fragile resource areas of the recreation area shall be administered on a low-intensity basis, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (j) Cooperative agreements for rescue, fire prevention and firefighting, and law enforcement services

  * (B) provide, subject to agreements that in the opinion of the Secretary will assure additional preservation of the lands and waters of the zone, such funds as may be necessary to retire bonded indebtedness for water and sewer and other utilities already incurred by property owners which in the opinion of the Secretary would if left outstanding contribute to further development of the zone in a manner inconsistent with the approved plan developed by the planning commission.
