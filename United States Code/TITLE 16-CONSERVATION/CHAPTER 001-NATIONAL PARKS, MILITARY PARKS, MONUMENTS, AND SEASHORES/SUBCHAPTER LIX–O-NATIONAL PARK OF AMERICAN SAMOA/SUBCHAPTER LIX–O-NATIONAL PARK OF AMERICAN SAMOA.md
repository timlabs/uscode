### SUBCHAPTER LIX–O—NATIONAL PARK OF AMERICAN SAMOA

### §410qq. Findings and purpose
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds that:

  * (1) Tropical forests are declining worldwide.

  * (2) Tropical forests contain 50 percent of the world's plant and animal species, contribute significantly to the advancement of science, medicine, and agriculture and produce much of the earth's oxygen. The loss of these forests leads to the extinction of species, lessening the world's biological diversity, reduces the potential for new medicines and crops and increases carbon dioxide levels in the atomosphere contributing to the greenhouse effect that is altering the global climate.

  * (3) The tropical forest of American Samoa is one of the last remaining undisturbed paleotropical forests.

  * (4) The tropical forest in American Samoa is the largest such forest under direct control of the United States.

  * (5) The tropical forest of American Samoa contains the habitat of one of the last remaining populations of Pacific flying foxes.

  * (6) The flying foxes of American Samoa are responsible for a large part of the pollination which maintains a significant portion of the species which inhabit the Samoan tropical forest.

  * (7) Information presently available indicates the existence of extensive archaeological evidence related to the development of the Samoan culture which needs to be examined and protected.

  * (8) The people of American Samoa have expressed a desire to have a portion of the tropical forest protected as a unit of the National Park System.

#### (b) Purpose
* The purpose of this subchapter is to preserve and protect the tropical forest and archaeological and cultural resources of American Samoa, and of associated reefs, to maintain the habitat of flying foxes, preserve the ecological balance of the Samoan tropical forest, and, consistent with the preservation of these resources, to provide for the enjoyment of the unique resources of the Samoan tropical forest by visitors from around the world.

### §410qq–1. Establishment
#### (a) In general
* In order to carry out the purposes expressed in section 410qq(b) of this title, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the "Secretary") shall establish the National Park of American Samoa (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the "park"). The Secretary shall establish the park only when the Governor of American Samoa has entered into a lease with the Secretary under which the Secretary will lease for a period of 50 years the lands and waters generally referred to in subsection (b) for use solely for purposes of the park. Immediately after October 31, 1988, the Secretary shall commence negotiations with the Governor of American Samoa respecting such a lease agreement. On or before the expiration of the lease agreement as set forth in this subsection, the Governor of American Samoa is encouraged to extend the lease to maintain the area as a unit of the National Park System. At such time as the lease may terminate the Government of American Samoa is urged to provide assurances to the Secretary that the lands and waters generally referred to in subsection (b) will be protected and preserved to the same standards as are applicable to national parks.

#### (b) Area included
* (1) The park shall consist of three units as generally depicted on the following maps entitled "Boundary Map, National Park of American Samoa": (A) map number NP–AS 80,000A, dated August 1988, (B) map number NP–AS 80,000B, dated August 1988, and (C) map number NP–AS 80,000C, dated August 1988. Before publication of the maps, the Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of American Samoa and other appropriate leaders, may adjust the boundaries of the park to correspond with the appropriate village boundaries and modify the maps accordingly.

* (2) The Secretary may make adjustments to the boundary of the park to include within the park certain portions of the islands of Ofu and Olosega, as depicted on the map entitled "National Park of American Samoa, Proposed Boundary Adjustment", numbered 82,035 and dated February 2002, pursuant to an agreement with the Governor of American Samoa and contingent upon the lease to the Secretary of the newly added lands. As soon as practicable after a boundary adjustment under this paragraph, the Secretary shall modify the maps referred to in paragraph (1) accordingly.

#### (c) Management by American Samoa
* Notwithstanding section 410qq–2(a) of this title, after 50 years after October 31, 1988, the Secretary shall, if requested by the Governor of American Samoa, enter into an extension of the lease referred to in subsection (a). If the Governor does not request such an extension the Secretary shall transfer to the Governor the sole authority to administer the park. Whenever the Secretary makes such a transfer he shall also transfer any improvements constructed by the Secretary in the park to the Governor without compensation.

#### (d) Compensation under lease agreement

Such deposits, together with the interest thereon, may be used only to cover the amounts of the lease payments due and payable pursuant to an agreement under this subsection. If the amounts deposited in such account, together with interest thereon, exceeds the amount of the lease payments due and payable at the time the agreement is entered into, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the excess shall be transferred to the accounts provided to the Secretary for operation and maintenance and for development of the park.
