* (1) Appropriated funds may not be used to acquire lands or interests therein within the park without the consent of the owner except when—

  * (A) the Secretary determines that such owner is subjecting, or is about to subject, the property to actions which would significantly degrade its value as a component of the park; or

  * (B) the owner fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (2).


* The Secretary shall immediately notify the owner in writing of any determination under subparagraph (A). If the owner immediately ceases the activity subject to such notification, the Secretary shall attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution prior to exercising any authority provided by subsection (a) of this section.

* (2) If an owner of lands or interests therein within the park intends to transfer any such lands or interest to persons other than the owner's immediate family, the owner shall notify the Secretary in writing of such intention. Within forty-five days after receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall respond in writing as to his interest in exercising a right of first refusal to purchase fee title or lesser interests. If, within such forty-five days, the Secretary declines to respond in writing or expresses no interest in exercising such right, the owner may proceed to transfer such interests. If the Secretary responds in writing within such forty-five days and expresses an interest and intention to exercise a right of first refusal, the Secretary shall initiate an action to exercise such right within ninety days after the date of the Secretary's response. If the Secretary fails to initiate action to exercise such right within such ninety days, the owner may proceed to otherwise transfer such interests.

The Secretary is thereupon directed to promptly issue such owner a certificate of exemption from condemnation for such actions proposed by the owner which the Secretary determines to be compatible with the purposes of the park.

#### (e) Limited right of retention; calculation of payment

The right retained may be for a definite term which shall not exceed twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner.
