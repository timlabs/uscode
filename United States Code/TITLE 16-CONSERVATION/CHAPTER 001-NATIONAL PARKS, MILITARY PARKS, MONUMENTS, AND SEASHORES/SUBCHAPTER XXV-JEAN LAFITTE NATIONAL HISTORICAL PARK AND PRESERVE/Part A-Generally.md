### §230b. Owner's retention of right of use and occupancy for residential purposes for life or fixed term of years; election of term; fair market value; transfer, assignment or termination; "improved property" defined
* Within the Barataria Preserve Unit, the owner or owners of improved property used for noncommercial residential purposes on a year-round basis may, as a condition of the acquisition of such property by the Secretary, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy of such property for noncommercial residential purposes if, in the judgment of the Secretary, the continued use of such property for a limited period would not unduly interfere with the development or management of the park.
