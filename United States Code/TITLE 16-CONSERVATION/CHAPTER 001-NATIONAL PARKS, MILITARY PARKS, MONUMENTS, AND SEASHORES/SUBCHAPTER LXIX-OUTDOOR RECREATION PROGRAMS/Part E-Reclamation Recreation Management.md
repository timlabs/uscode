### PART E—RECLAMATION RECREATION MANAGEMENT

### §460_l_–31. Findings
* The Congress finds and declares the following:

  * (1) There is a Federal responsibility to provide opportunities for public recreation at Federal water projects.

  * (2) Some provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460l–12 et seq.] are outdated because of increases in demand for outdoor recreation and changes in the economic climate for recreation managing entities.

  * (3) Provisions of such Act relating to non-Federal responsibility for all costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement of recreation facilities result in an unfair burden, especially in cases where the facilities are old or underdesigned.

  * (4) Provisions of such Act that limit the Federal share of recreation facility development at water projects completed before 1965 to $100,000 preclude a responsible Federal share in providing adequate opportunities for safe outdoor recreation.

  * (5) There should be Federal authority to expand existing recreation facilities to meet public demand, in partnership with non-Federal interests.

  * (6) Nothing in this part changes the responsibility of the Bureau to meet the purposes for which Federal Reclamation projects were initially authorized and constructed.

  * (7) It is therefore in the best interest of the people of this Nation to amend the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460l–12 et seq.] to remove outdated restrictions and authorize the Secretary of the Interior to undertake specific measures for the management of Reclamation lands.
