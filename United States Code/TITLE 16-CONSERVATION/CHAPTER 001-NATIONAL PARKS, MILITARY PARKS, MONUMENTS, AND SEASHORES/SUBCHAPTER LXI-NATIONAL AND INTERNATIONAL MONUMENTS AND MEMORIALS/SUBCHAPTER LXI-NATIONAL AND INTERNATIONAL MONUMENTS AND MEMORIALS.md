* (a) All Federal lands and interests in lands within the Badlands Air Force gunnery range that are outside the boundaries of the park and that heretofore or hereafter are declared excess to the needs of the Department of the Air Force shall be transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior without a transfer of funds.

  * (1) The purchase price to a former Indian owner shall be the total amount paid by the United States to acquire such tract and all interests therein, plus interest thereon from the date of acquisition at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the average market yield of all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States at the time the tract was acquired by the United States, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. The purchase price to a former non-Indian owner shall be present fair market value of the tract as determined by the Secretary of the Interior.

  * (2) Not less than $100 or 20 per centum of the purchase price, whichever is less, shall be paid at the time of purchase, and the balance shall be payable in not to exceed 20 years with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into account the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with twenty years remaining to date of maturity, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.

  * (3) Title to the tract purchased shall be held in trust for the purchaser if it was held in trust status at the time the tract was acquired by the United States; otherwise, the title to the tract purchased shall be conveyed to the purchaser subject to a mortgage and such other security instruments as the Secretary deems appropriate. If a tract purchased under this subsection is offered for resale during the following ten-year period, the tribe must be given the first right to purchase it.

  * (4) The unpaid balance of the purchase price shall be a lien against the land if the title is held in trust and against all rents, bonuses, and royalties received therefrom. In the event of default in the payment of any installment of the purchase price the Secretary may take such action to enforce the lien as he deems appropriate, including foreclosure and conveyance of the land to the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

  * (5) An application to purchase the tract must be filed with the Secretary of the Interior within one year from the date a notice is published in the Federal Register that the tract has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Secretary.

  * (6) No application may be filed by more than five of the former owners of an interest in the tract. If more than one such application is filed for a tract the applicants must agree on not more than five of the former owners who shall make the purchase, and failing such agreement all such applications for the tract shall be rejected by the Secretary.

  * (7) "Former owner" means, for the purposes of subsection (b) of this section, each person from whom the United States acquired an interest in the tract, or if such person is deceased, his spouse, or if such spouse is deceased, his children.

* Congress finds that—

  * (1) few events in the past quarter-century have rocked Americans' perception of themselves and their institutions, and brought together the people of our Nation with greater intensity than the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City;

  * (4) such losses and struggles are personal and, since they resulted from so public an attack, they are also shared with a community, a Nation, and the world;

The responses of Oklahoma's public servants and private citizens, and those from throughout the Nation, remain as a testament to the sense of unity, compassion, even heroism, that characterized the rescue and recovery following the bombing;

  * (6) during the days immediately following the Oklahoma City bombing, Americans and people from around the world of all races, political philosophies, religions and walks of life responded with unprecedented solidarity and selflessness; and

  * (7) given the national and international impact and reaction, the Federal character of the site of the bombing, and the significant percentage of the victims and survivors who were Federal employees, the Oklahoma City Memorial will be established, designed, managed and maintained to educate present and future generations, through a public/private partnership, to work together efficiently and respectfully in developing a National Memorial relating to all aspects of the April 19, 1995, bombing in Oklahoma City.
