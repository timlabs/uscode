### SUBCHAPTER LXXXII—SLEEPING BEAR DUNES NATIONAL LAKESHORE

### §460x. Establishment
#### (a) Purpose; administration
* The Congress finds that certain outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena, exist along the mainland shore of Lake Michigan and on certain nearby islands in Benzie and Leelanau Counties, Michigan, and that such features ought to be preserved in their natural setting and protected from developments and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty and natural character of the area. In order to accomplish this purpose for the benefit, inspiration, education, recreation, and enjoyment of the public, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") is authorized to take appropriate action, as herein provided, to establish in the State of Michigan the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, the Secretary shall administer and protect the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in a manner which provides for recreational opportunities consistent with the maximum protection of the natural environment within the area.

#### (b) Cooperation between Federal, State, and local governments
* In preserving the lakeshore and stabilizing its development, substantial reliance shall be placed on cooperation between Federal, State, and local governments to apply sound principles of land use planning and zoning. In developing the lakeshore, full recognition shall be given to protecting the private properties for the enjoyment of the owners.

### §460x–1. Description of area
#### (a) In general
* The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (hereinafter referred to as the "lakeshore") shall comprise the land and water area generally depicted on the map entitled "A Proposed Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Boundary Map", numbered NL–SBD–91,000 and dated May 1969, which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior.

#### (b) Establishment; notice in Federal Register
* As soon as practicable after October 21, 1970, and following the acquisition by the Secretary of those lands owned by the State of Michigan within the boundaries of the area designated for inclusion in the lakeshore (excepting not to exceed three hundred acres in the Platte Bay area) and of such additional lands, if any, as are necessary to provide an area which in his opinion is efficiently administrable for the purposes of this subchapter, he shall establish the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore by publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register.

### §460x–2. Designation of lakeshore areas
#### (a) Area categories; publication in Federal Register
* Within thirty days, or as soon as possible thereafter, after October 21, 1970, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a map or other description of the lakeshore delineating areas constituting the following categories:

* Category I, public use and development areas.

* Category II, environmental conservation areas.

* Category III, private use and development areas.

#### (b) Acquisition of lands and interests therein of category I areas
* Lands and interests therein designated as category I may be acquired by the Secretary in accordance with section 460x–7 of this title.

#### (c) Designation of lands as within categories II and III for acquisition by Secretary; publication in Federal Register
* Within one hundred and fifty days after October 21, 1970, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register an additional map or other description of those lands, if any, designated as within categories II and III for acquisition by him in fee in accordance with section 460x–7 of this title.

#### (d) Acquisition of interests in lands designated as category II; limitations
* Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may, after the publication provided for in subsection (c), acquire only such interests in lands designated as category II, other than those to be acquired in fee simple, as he deems appropriate to insure the continued conservation and preservation of the environmental quality of the lakeshore.

#### (e) Acquisition of interests in lands designated as category III; limitations
* Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may, after the publication provided for in subsection (c), acquire only such interests in lands designated as category III, other than those lands to be acquired in fee simple, as he deems appropriate to protect lands designated for acquisition.

#### (f) Restrictions on use and development of real property in categories II and III; notification of owners by Secretary of minimum restrictions on use and development for retention of property; compliance with restrictions as barring acquisition by Secretary; applicability to owners not notified by Secretary; acquisition from owners not agreeing to use of property in accordance with notice; acquisition of fee simple title
* Not later than one hundred and fifty days after October 21, 1970, the Secretary shall notify owners of real property in categories II and III, other than property designated by him for fee acquisition, of the minimum restrictions on use and development of such property under which such property can be retained in a manner compatible with the purpose for which the lakeshore was established. If the owner of any real property in categories II and III agrees to the use and development of his property in accordance with such restrictions, the Secretary may not acquire, without the consent of such owner, such property or interests therein for so long as the property affected is used in accordance with such restrictions, unless he determines that such property is needed for public use development. The foregoing limitations on acquisition shall also apply to any owners of real property to whom the Secretary did not, within the time set forth, give such a notice, except that if any property owner has not, within ninety days of the notice agreed to use the property in accordance with the notice, then the Secretary may acquire, without limitation, fee or lesser interests in property by any of the methods set forth in section 460x–7 of this title: _Provided_, That nothing contained in subsections (d) and (e), and in this subsection, which limits the acquisition of the fee simple title to property within the lakeshore, shall prevent the Secretary from acquiring, without the consent of the owner, the fee simple title whenever in the Secretary's judgment the estimated cost of acquiring the lesser interest would be a substantial percentage of the estimated cost of acquiring the fee simple title.

#### (c) State donations; transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary
* Any property or interests therein, owned by the State of Michigan or any political subdivisions thereof, may be acquired only by donation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any property owned by the United States on October 21, 1970, located within such area may, with the concurrence of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for use by him in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter.

#### (e) Condemnation to acquire clear, marketable, and encumbrance-free title
* Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit the use of condemnation as a means of acquiring a clear and marketable title, free of any and all encumbrances.

### §460x–8. Zoning bylaws
#### (a) Authority of Secretary to assist any township or county in or adjacent to lakeshore; payments for technical aid
* The Secretary shall, at the request of any township or county in or adjacent to the lakeshore affected by this subchapter, assist and consult with the appropriate officers and employees of such township or county in establishing zoning bylaws for the purpose of this subchapter. Such assistance may include payments to the county or township for technical aid.

#### (b) Suspension of condemnation power over improved property
* No improved property within the area designated for inclusion in the lakeshore shall be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation so long as the affected county or township has in force and applicable thereto a duly adopted, valid zoning bylaw approved by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section and the use of improved property is in compliance therewith. In the event that the affected county or township does not have in effect and applicable to any improved property a duly adopted, valid zoning bylaw so approved, the Secretary shall be prohibited from acquiring such property by condemnation, if the owner thereof notifies the Secretary in writing of such owner's agreement to use his property in a manner consistent with the applicable standard set forth in subsection (d) of this section, and such prohibition against condemnation shall remain in effect for so long as such property is so used.

#### (c) Notification of owner by Secretary of use of property inconsistent with applicable bylaws or standards; requirements of notice; discontinuance of use by owner; condemnation upon failure to discontinue use
* If the Secretary determines that any such property referred to in subsection (b) of this section covered by any such bylaw is being used in a way which is not in substantial compliance with such bylaw, or that any such property referred to in subsection (b) with respect to which an agreement has been made is being used in a manner which is not substantially consistent with such applicable standards, he shall so notify the owner of any such property in writing. Such notice shall contain a detailed statement as to why the Secretary believes that such use is not in substantial compliance with such zoning bylaw or why such use is not substantially consistent with such applicable standards, as the case may be. Any such owner shall have sixty days following the receipt by him of that written notification within which to discontinue the use referred to in such notification. Discontinuance of such use within such sixty-day period shall have the effect of prohibiting the Secretary from acquiring such property by condemnation by reason of such use. In any case in which such use is not discontinued within such sixty-day period, the Secretary may, in his discretion, acquire such property by condemnation.

#### (d) Conditions for approval by Secretary
* Any zoning bylaw or amendment thereto submitted to the Secretary for approval for the purposes of this subchapter shall be approved by him if such bylaw or amendment contains provisions which—

  * (1) contribute to the effect of prohibiting the commercial and industrial use (other than a use for a commercial purpose as authorized under section 460x–12 of this title) of all property within the boundaries of such area which is situated within the county or township adopting such bylaw or amendment;

  * (2) are consistent with the objectives and purposes of this subchapter so that, to the extent possible under Michigan law, the scenic and scientific values of the lakeshore area will be protected;

  * (3) are designed to preserve the lakeshore character of the area by appropriate restrictions upon the burning of cover, cutting of timber (except tracts managed for sustained yield), removal of sand or gravel, and dumping, storage, or piling of refuse and other unsightly objects or other uses which would detract from the natural or traditional lakeshore scene;

  * (4) provide that no construction, reconstruction, moving, alteration, or enlargement of any property, including improved property as defined in this subchapter, within the lakeshore area shall be permitted, if such construction, reconstruction, moving, alteration, or enlargement would afford less than a fifty-foot setback from all streets measured at a right angle with the street line, and a twenty-five-foot distance from all contiguous properties. Any owner or zoning authority may request the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether a proposed move, alteration, construction, reconstruction, or enlargement of any such property would subject such property to acquisition by condemnation, and the Secretary, within sixty days of the receipt of such request, shall advise the owner or zoning authority in writing whether the intended use will subject the property to acquisition by condemnation; and

  * (5) have the effect of providing that the Secretary shall receive notice of any variance granted under, and of any exception made to the application of, such bylaw or amendment.

#### (e) Withdrawal or revocation of approval by Secretary; retroactive effect
* The approval of any bylaw or amendment pursuant to subsection (d) shall not be withdrawn or revoked by the Secretary for so long as such bylaw or amendment remains in effect as approved. Any such bylaw or amendment so approved shall not be retroactive in its application.

#### (c) Limitation on use in instrument evidencing right; Secretary's power of termination of right
* Any deed or other instrument used to transfer title to property, with respect to which a right of use and occupancy is retained under this section, and any instrument evidencing any right of use and occupancy retained by any occupier under this section, shall provide that such property shall not be used for any purpose which is incompatible with purposes of this subchapter, or which impairs the usefulness and attractiveness of such area, and if it should be so used, that the Secretary many terminate such right.
