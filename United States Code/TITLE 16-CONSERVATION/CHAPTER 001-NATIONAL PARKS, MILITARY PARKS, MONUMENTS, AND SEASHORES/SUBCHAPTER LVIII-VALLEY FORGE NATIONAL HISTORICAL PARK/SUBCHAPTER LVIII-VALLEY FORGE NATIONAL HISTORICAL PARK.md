### SUBCHAPTER LVIII—VALLEY FORGE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK

### §410aa. Establishment
* In order to preserve and commemorate for the people of the United States the area associated with the heroic suffering, hardship, and determination and resolve of General George Washington's Continental Army during the winter of 1777–1778 at Valley Forge, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") is authorized to establish the Valley Forge National Historical Park (hereinafter referred to as the "park"), in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

### §410aa–1. Lands and property
#### (a) Boundaries; inspection of map
* The park shall comprise the area generally depicted on the map entitled "Valley Forge National Historical Park", dated June 1979, and numbered VF–91,001, which shall be on file and available for inspection in the offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, and in the offices of the superintendent of the park. After advising the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, in writing, the Secretary may make minor revisions of the boundaries of the park when necessary by publication of a revised map or other boundary description in the Federal Register.

#### (b) Acquisition of lands
* Within the boundaries of the park, the Secretary may acquire lands and interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer. Any property owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation. The effective date of such donation shall not be prior to October 1, 1976.

#### (c) Reservation of rights by grantors; compensation for land
* Except for property deemed by the Secretary to be essential for visitor facilities, or for access to or administration of the park, any owner or owners of improved property on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may, as a condition of such acquisition, retain for themselves and their successors or assigns a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for noncommercial residential purposes for a definite term not to exceed twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner, or the death of his or her spouse, whichever is the later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value on such date of the right retained by the owner.

#### (d) Termination of grantor's rights
* The Secretary may terminate a right of use and occupancy retained pursuant to this section upon his determination that such use and occupancy is being exercised in a manner not consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, and upon tender to the holder of the right of an amount equal to the fair market value of that portion of the right which remains unexpired on the date of termination.

#### (e) "Improved property" defined
* The term "improved property", as used in this section shall mean a detached, noncommercial residential dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1975 (hereafter referred to as "dwelling"), together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, the said land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures accessory to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated.

### §410aa–2. Notice in Federal Register; appropriations; administration
* When the Secretary determines that lands and interests therein have been acquired in an amount sufficient to constitute an administerable unit, he shall establish the park by publication of a notice to that effect in the Federal Register: _Provided_, That the park shall not be established until the Secretary receives commitments which he deems to be sufficient from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the appropriations made by acts 320 and 352 of 1974, and act 12A of 1975, of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, will continue to be available and obligated for development purposes within the park. The Secretary shall administer the property acquired for such park in accordance with the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535), as amended and supplemented, and the Act of August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666), as amended. In furtherance of the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance to public and private nonprofit entities in qualifying for appropriate historical designation and for such grants, other financial assistance, and other forms of aid as are available under Federal, State, or local law for the protection, rehabilitation, or preservation of properties in the vicinity of the park which are historically related to the purposes of the park.

### §410aa–3. Authorization of appropriations
* (a) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, but not more than $13,895,000 for the acquisition of lands and interests in lands.

* (b) For the development of essential public facilities there are authorized to be appropriated not more than $500,000. Within three years from the date of establishment of the park pursuant to this subchapter, the Secretary shall, after consulting with the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, develop and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives a final master plan for the development of the park consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, indicating:

  * (1) the facilities needed to accommodate the health, safety, and interpretive needs of the visiting public;

  * (2) the location and estimated cost of all facilities; and

  * (3) the projected need for any additional facilities within the park.
