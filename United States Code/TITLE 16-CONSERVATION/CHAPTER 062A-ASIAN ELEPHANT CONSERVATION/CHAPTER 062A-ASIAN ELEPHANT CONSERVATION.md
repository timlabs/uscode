### **CHAPTER 62A—ASIAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION**

### §4261. Findings
* The Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Asian elephant populations in nations within the range of Asian elephants have continued to decline to the point that the long-term survival of the species in the wild is in serious jeopardy.

  * (2) The Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species under section 1533 of this title and under appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

  * (3) Because the challenges facing the conservation of Asian elephants are so great, resources to date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat and the consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations.

  * (4) The Asian elephant is a flagship species for the conservation of tropical forest habitats in which it is found and provides the consequent benefit from such conservation to numerous other species of wildlife including many other endangered species.

  * (5) Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to habitat loss are population fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, poaching for ivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and capture for domestication.

  * (6) To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address these threats to the long-term viability of populations of Asian elephants in the wild will require the joint commitment and effort of nations within the range of Asian elephants, the United States and other countries, and the private sector.

### §4262. Purposes
* The purposes of this chapter are the following:

  * (1) To perpetuate healthy populations of Asian elephants.

  * (2) To assist in the conservation and protection of Asian elephants by supporting the conservation programs of Asian elephant range states and the CITES Secretariat.

  * (3) To provide financial resources for those programs.

### §4263. Definitions
* In this chapter:

  * (1) The term "CITES" means the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, signed on March 3, 1973, and its appendices.

  * (2) The term "conservation" means the use of methods and procedures necessary to bring Asian elephants to the point at which there are sufficient populations in the wild to ensure that the species does not become extinct, including all activities associated with scientific resource management, such as conservation, protection, restoration, acquisition, and management of habitat; research and monitoring of known populations; assistance in the development of management plans for managed elephant ranges; CITES enforcement; law enforcement through community participation; translocation of elephants; conflict resolution initiatives; and community outreach and education.

  * (3) The term "Fund" means the account established by division A, section 101(e), title I of Public Law 105–277 under the heading "multinational species conservation fund" [16 U.S.C. 4246].

  * (4) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Interior.

  * (5) The term "Administrator" means the Administrator of the Agency for International Development.

### §4264. Asian elephant conservation assistance
