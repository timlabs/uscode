* (1) During the period beginning on December 23, 1985, and ending on the later of January 1, 1990, or the date that is 2 years after the date land on which a crop of an agricultural commodity is produced was mapped by the Soil Conservation Service for purposes of classifying such land under the land capability classification system in effect on December 23, 1985, except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall become ineligible under section 3811 of this title for program loans, payments, and benefits as the result of the production of a crop of an agricultural commodity on any land that was—

  * (A) cultivated to produce any of the 1981 through 1985 crops of an agricultural commodity; or

  * (B) set aside, diverted or otherwise not cultivated under a program administered by the Secretary for any such crops to reduce production of an agricultural commodity.


* (2) ELIGIBILITY BASED ON COMPLIANCE WITH CONSERVATION PLAN.—

  * (A) IN GENERAL.—If, as of January 1, 1990, or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey for the farm, whichever is later, a person is actively applying a conservation plan, such person shall have until January 1, 1995, to comply with the plan without being subject to program ineligibility.

  * (B) MINIMIZATION OF DOCUMENTATION.—In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary, Soil Conservation Service, and local soil conservation districts shall minimize the quantity of documentation a person must submit to comply with this paragraph.

  * (C) CROP INSURANCE.—

    * (i) OPERATIONS NEW TO COMPLIANCE.—Notwithstanding section 3811(a) of this title, in the case of a person that is subject to section 3811 of this title for the first time solely due to the amendment made by section 2611(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014, any person who produces an agricultural commodity on the land that is the basis of the payments described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title shall have 5 reinsurance years after the date on which such payments become subject to section 3811 of this title to develop and comply with an approved conservation plan so as to maintain eligibility for such payments.

    * (ii) EXISTING OPERATIONS WITH PRIOR VIOLATIONS.—Notwithstanding section 3811(a) of this title, in the case of a person that the Secretary determines would have been in violation of section 3811(a) of this title if the person had continued participation in the programs requiring compliance at any time after February 7, 2014, and is currently in violation of section 3811(a) of this title, the person shall have 2 reinsurance years after the date on which the payments described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title become subject to section 3811 of this title to develop and comply with an approved conservation plan, as determined by the Secretary, so as to maintain eligibility for such payments.

    * (iii) APPLICABLE REINSURANCE YEAR.—Ineligibility for the payment described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title for a violation under this subparagraph during a crop year shall—
