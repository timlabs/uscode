### SUBCHAPTER III—RESEARCH PROGRAMS

### §582a. Congressional findings
* It is recognized that research in forestry is the driving force behind progress in developing and utilizing the resources of the Nation's forest and related rangelands. The production, protection, and utilization of the forest resources depend on strong technological advances and continuing development of the knowledge necessary to increase the efficiency of forestry practices and to extend the benefits that flow from forest and related rangelands. It is recognized that the total forestry research efforts of the several State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government are more fully effective if there is close coordination between such programs, and it is further recognized that forestry schools are especially vital in the training of research workers in forestry. It is also recognized that the provisions of this subchapter are essential to assist in providing the research background that undergirds the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 [16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.], the Renewable Resources Extension Act of 1978, and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 [16 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.].

### §582a–1. Cooperation by Secretary of Agriculture with States; assistance: plans, eligible institutions and amount
* In order to promote research in forestry, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the several States for the purpose of encouraging and assisting them in carrying out programs of forestry research.

* Such assistance shall be in accordance with plans to be agreed upon in advance by the Secretary and (a) land-grant colleges or agricultural experiment stations established under the Morrill Act of July 2, 1862, as amended [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], and the Hatch Act of March 2, 1887, as amended [7 U.S.C. 361a et seq.], 1890 Institutions (as defined in section 7601 of title 7), and 1994 Institutions (as defined in section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note; Public Law 103–382)) that offer an associate's degree or a baccalaureate degree in forestry, and (b) other State-supported colleges and universities offering graduate training in the sciences basic to forestry and having a forestry school; however, an appropriate State representative designated by the State's Governor shall, in any agreement drawn up with the Secretary of Agriculture for the purposes of this subchapter, certify those eligible institutions of the State which will qualify for assistance and shall determine the proportionate amounts of assistance to be extended these certified institutions. If more than one institution within a State are certified as qualifying for assistance, then it shall be the responsibility of such institutions, in agreement with the Secretary, to develop complementary programs of forestry research for the State.

### §582a–2. Authorization of appropriations; other allotments and grants
* To enable the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary but not exceeding in any one fiscal year one-half the amount appropriated for Federal forestry research conducted directly by the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year preceding the year in which the budget is presented for such appropriation. Funds appropriated and made available to the States under this subchapter shall be in addition to allotments or grants that may be made under other authorizations.

### §582a–3. Matching funds; reapportionment to other qualifying institutions; reductions
* The amount paid by the Federal Government to any State-certified institutions eligible for assistance under this subchapter shall not exceed during any fiscal year the amount available to and budgeted for expenditure by such college or university during the same fiscal year for forestry research from non-Federal sources, except that for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1971, and June 30, 1972, the matching funds requirement hereof shall not be applicable to the Virgin Islands and Guam, and sums authorized for such years for the Virgin Islands and Guam may be used to pay the total cost of programs for forestry research. The Secretary is authorized to make such expenditures on the certificate of the appropriate official of the college or university having charge of the forestry research for which the expenditures as herein provided are to be made. If any or all of the colleges or universities certified for receipt of funds under this subchapter fails to make available and budget for expenditure for forestry research in any fiscal year sums at least as much as the amount for which it would be eligible for such year under this subchapter, the difference between the Federal funds available and the funds made available and budgeted for expenditure by the college or university shall be reapportioned by the Secretary to other eligible colleges or universities of the same State if there be any which qualify therefor and, if there be none, the Secretary shall reapportion such differences to the qualifying colleges and universities of other States participating in the forestry research program. If in any year the amount made available by a State from its own funds (including any revenue-sharing funds) to a State-certified institution eligible for assistance under this subchapter is reduced because of an increase in the allotment made available under this subchapter, the allotment of such State-certified institution from the next succeeding appropriation shall be reduced in an equivalent amount. The Secretary shall reapportion the amount of such reduction to other eligible colleges and universities of the same State if there be any that qualify therefor and, if there be none, the Secretary shall reapportion such amount to the qualifying colleges and universities of other States participating in the forestry research program.

### §582a–4. Regulations; advice and assistance; appointment, membership, etc., of council
#### (a) Regulations and assistance
* The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this subchapter and to furnish such advice and assistance through a cooperative State forestry research unit in the Department as will best promote the purposes of this subchapter.

#### (b) Advisory council
* The Secretary shall appoint a council of not fewer than sixteen members which shall be constituted to give representation to Federal and State agencies concerned with developing and utilizing the Nation's forest resources, the forest industries, the forestry schools of the State-certified eligible institutions, State agricultural experiment stations, and volunteer public groups concerned with forests and related natural resources. The council shall meet at least annually and shall submit a report to the Secretary on regional and national planning and coordination of forestry research within the Federal and State agencies, forestry schools, and the forest industries, and shall advise the Secretary on the apportionment of funds. The Secretary shall seek, at least once each year, the advice of the council to accomplish efficiently the purposes of this subchapter.

### §582a–5. Apportionments, advice, criteria, etc.
* Apportionments among participating States shall be determined by the Secretary after consultation with the council appointed under section 582a–4 of this title. In making such apportionments, consideration shall be given to pertinent factors including non-Federal expenditures for forestry research by State-certified eligible institutions, areas of non-Federal commercial forest land, and the volume of timber cut annually. Three per centum of such funds as may be appropriated shall be made available to the Secretary for administration of this subchapter. These administrative funds may be used for transportation of scientists who are not officers or employees of the United States to research meetings convened for purposes of assessing research opportunities or research planning.
