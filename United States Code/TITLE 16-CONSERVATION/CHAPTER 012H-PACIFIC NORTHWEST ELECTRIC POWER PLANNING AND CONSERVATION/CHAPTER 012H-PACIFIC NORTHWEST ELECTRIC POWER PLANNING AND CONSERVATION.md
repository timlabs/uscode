The adopted plan, or any portion thereof, may be amended from time to time, and shall be reviewed by the Council not less frequently than once every five years. Prior to such adoption, public hearings shall be held in each Council member's State on the plan or substantial, nontechnical amendments to the plan proposed by the Council for adoption. A public hearing shall also be held in any other State of the region on the plan or amendments thereto, if the Council determines that the plan or amendments would likely have a substantial impact on that State in terms of major resources which may be developed in that State and which the Administrator may seek to acquire. Action of the Council under this subsection concerning such hearings shall be subject to section 553 of title 5 and such procedure as the Council shall adopt.

* (2) Following adoption of the plan and any amendment thereto, all actions of the Administrator pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be consistent with the plan and any amendment thereto, except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter.

#### (e) Plan priorities and requisite features; studies
* (1) The plan shall, as provided in this paragraph, give priority to resources which the Council determines to be cost-effective. Priority shall be given: first, to conservation; second, to renewable resources; third, to generating resources utilizing waste heat or generating resources of high fuel conversion efficiency; and fourth, to all other resources.

* (2) The plan shall set forth a general scheme for implementing conservation measures and developing resources pursuant to section 839d of this title to reduce or meet the Administrator's obligations with due consideration by the Council for (A) environmental quality, (B) compatibility with the existing regional power system, (C) protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife and related spawning grounds and habitat, including sufficient quantities and qualities of flows for successful migration, survival, and propagation of anadromous fish, and (D) other criteria which may be set forth in the plan.

* (3) To accomplish the priorities established by this subsection, the plan shall include the following elements which shall be set forth in such detail as the Council determines to be appropriate:

  * (A) an energy conservation program to be implemented under this chapter, including, but not limited to, model conservation standards;

  * (B) recommendation for research and development;

  * (C) a methodology for determining quantifiable environmental costs and benefits under section 839a(4) of this title;

  * (D) a demand forecast of at least twenty years (developed in consultation with the Administrator, the customers, the States, including State agencies with ratemaking authority over electric utilities, and the public, in such manner as the Council deems appropriate) and a forecast of power resources estimated by the Council to be required to meet the Administrator's obligations and the portion of such obligations the Council determines can be met by resources in each of the priority categories referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection which forecast (i) shall include regional reliability and reserve requirements, (ii) shall take into account the effect, if any, of the requirements of subsection (h) on the availability of resources to the Administrator, and (iii) shall include the approximate amounts of power the Council recommends should be acquired by the Administrator on a long-term basis and may include, to the extent practicable, an estimate of the types of resources from which such power should be acquired;

  * (E) an analysis of reserve and reliability requirements and cost-effective methods of providing reserves designed to insure adequate electric power at the lowest probable cost;

  * (F) the program adopted pursuant to subsection (h); and

  * (G) if the Council recommends surcharges pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, a methodology for calculating such surcharges.


* (4) The Council, taking into consideration the requirement that it devote its principal efforts to carrying out its responsibilities under subsections (d) and (h) of this section, shall undertake studies of conservation measures reasonably available to direct service industrial customers and other major consumers of electric power within the region and make an analysis of the estimated reduction in energy use which would result from the implementation of such measures as rapidly as possible, consistent with sound business practices. The Council shall consult with such customers and consumers in the conduct of such studies.

#### (f) Model conservation standards; surcharges
* (1) Model conservation standards to be included in the plan shall include, but not be limited to, standards applicable to (A) new and existing structures, (B) utility, customer, and governmental conservation programs, and (C) other consumer actions for achieving conservation. Model conservation standards shall reflect geographic and climatic differences within the region and other appropriate considerations, and shall be designed to produce all power savings that are cost-effective for the region and economically feasible for consumers, taking into account financial assistance made available to consumers under section 839d(a) of this title. These model conservation standards shall be adopted by the Council and included in the plan after consultation, in such manner as the Council deems appropriate, with the Administrator, States, and political subdivisions, customers of the Administrator, and the public.

* (2) The Council by a majority vote of the members of the Council is authorized to recommend to the Administrator a surcharge and the Administrator may thereafter impose such a surcharge, in accordance with the methodology provided in the plan, on customers for those portions of their loads within the region that are within States or political subdivisions which have not, or on the Administrator's customers which have not, implemented conservation measures that achieve energy savings which the Administrator determines are comparable to those which would be obtained under such standards. Such surcharges shall be established to recover such additional costs as the Administrator determines will be incurred because such projected energy savings attributable to such conservation measures have not been achieved, but in no case may such surcharges be less than 10 per centum or more than 50 per centum of the Administrator's applicable rates for such load or portion thereof.

#### (g) Public information; consultation; contracts and technical assistance

* (5) The Administrator shall include in contracts executed in accordance with this subsection provisions that enable the Administrator to restrict his contractual obligations to meet the loads referred to in this subsection in the future if the Administrator determines, after a reasonable period of experience under this chapter, that the Administrator cannot be assured on a planning basis of acquiring sufficient resources to meet such loads during a specified period of insufficiency. Any such contract with a public body, cooperative, or Federal agency shall specify a reasonable minimum period between a notice of restriction and the earliest date such restriction may be imposed.

* (6) Contracts executed in accordance with this subsection with public body, cooperative, and Federal agency customers shall—

  * (A) provide that the restriction referred to in paragraph (5) shall not be applicable to any such customers until the operating year in which the total of such customers' firm loads to be served by the Administrator equals or exceeds the firm capability of the Federal base system resources;

  * (B) not permit restrictions which would reduce the total contractual entitlement of such customers to an amount less than the firm capability of the Federal base system resources; and

  * (C) contain a formula for determining annually, on a uniform basis, each such customer's contractual entitlement to firm power during such a period of restriction, which formula shall not consider customer resources other than those the customer has determined, as of December 5, 1980, to be used to serve its own firm loads.


* The formula referred to in subparagraph (C) shall obligate the Administrator to provide on an annual basis only firm power needed to serve the portion of such customer's firm load in excess of the capability of such customer's own firm resources determined by such customer under paragraph (1) of this subsection to be used to serve its firm load.

* (7) REQUIRED SALE.—

  * (A) DEFINITION OF A JOINT OPERATING ENTITY.—In this section, the term "joint operating entity" means an entity that is lawfully organized under State law as a public body or cooperative prior to September 22, 2000, and is formed by and whose members or participants are two or more public bodies or cooperatives, each of which was a customer of the Bonneville Power Administration on or before January 1, 1999.

  * (B) SALE.—Pursuant to paragraph (1), the Administrator shall sell, at wholesale to a joint operating entity, electric power solely for the purpose of meeting the regional firm power consumer loads of regional public bodies and cooperatives that are members of or participants in the joint operating entity.

  * (C) NO RESALE.—A public body or cooperative to which a joint operating entity sells electric power under subparagraph (B) shall not resell that power except to retail customers of the public body or cooperative or to another regional member or participant of the same joint operating entity, or except as otherwise permitted by law.

#### (c) Purchase and exchange sales
* (1) Whenever a Pacific Northwest electric utility offers to sell electric power to the Administrator at the average system cost of that utility's resources in each year, the Administrator shall acquire by purchase such power and shall offer, in exchange, to sell an equivalent amount of electric power to such utility for resale to that utility's residential users within the region.

* (2) The purchase and exchange sale referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection with any electric utility shall be limited to an amount not in excess of 50 per centum of such utility's Regional residential load in the year beginning July 1, 1980, such 50 per centum limit increasing in equal annual increments to 100 per centum of such load in the year beginning July 1, 1985, and each year thereafter.

* (3) The cost benefits, as specified in contracts with the Administrator, of any purchase and exchange sale referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection which are attributable to any electric utility's residential load within a State shall be passed through directly to such utility's residential loads within such State, except that a State which lies partially within and partially without the region may require that such cost benefits be distributed among all of the utility's residential loads in that State.

* (4) An electric utility may terminate, upon reasonable terms and conditions agreed to by the Administrator and such utility prior to such termination, its purchase and sale under this subsection if the supplemental rate charge provided for in section 839e(b)(3) of this title is applied and the cost of electric power sold to such utility under this subsection exceeds, after application of such rate charge, the average system cost of power sold by such utility to the Administrator under this subsection.

* (5) Subject to the provisions of sections 839b and 839d of this title, in lieu of purchasing any amount of electric power offered by a utility under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator may acquire an equivalent amount of electric power from other sources to replace power sold to such utility as part of an exchange sale if the cost of such acquisition is less than the cost of purchasing the electric power offered by such utility.

* (6) Exchange sales to a utility pursuant to this subsection shall not be restricted below the amounts of electric power acquired by the Administrator from, or on behalf of, such utility pursuant to this subsection.

* (7) The "average system cost" for electric power sold to the Administrator under this subsection shall be determined by the Administrator on the basis of a methodology developed for this purpose in consultation with the Council, the Administrator's customers, and appropriate State regulatory bodies in the region. Such methodology shall be subject to review and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Such average system cost shall not include—

  * (A) the cost of additional resources in an amount sufficient to serve any new large single load of the utility;

  * (B) the cost of additional resources in an amount sufficient to meet any additional load outside the region occurring after December 5, 1980; and

  * (C) any costs of any generating facility which is terminated prior to initial commercial operation.

#### (d) Sales to existing direct service industrial customers
* (1)(A) The Administrator is authorized to sell in accordance with this subsection electric power to existing direct service industrial customers. Such sales shall provide a portion of the Administrator's reserves for firm power loads within the region.

* (B) After December 5, 1980, the Administrator shall offer in accordance with subsection (g) of this section to each existing direct service industrial customer an initial long term contract that provides such customer an amount of power equivalent to that to which such customer is entitled under its contract dated January or April 1975 providing for the sale of "industrial firm power."

* (2) The Administrator shall not sell electric power, including reserves, directly to new direct service industrial customers.

* (3) The Administrator shall not sell amounts of electric power, including reserves, to existing direct service industrial customers in excess of the amount permitted under paragraph (1) unless the Administrator determines, after a plan has been adopted pursuant to section 839b of this title, that such proposed sale is consistent with the plan and that—

  * (A) additional power system reserves are required for the region's firm loads,

  * (B) the proposed sale would provide a cost-effective method of supplying such reserves,

  * (C) such loads or loads of similar character cannot provide equivalent operating or planning benefits to the region if served by an electric utility under contractual arrangements providing reserves, and

  * (D) the Administrator has or can acquire sufficient electric power to serve such loads, and


* unless the Council has determined such sale is consistent with the plan. After such determination by the Administrator and by the Council, the Administrator is authorized to offer to existing direct service industrial customers power in such amounts in excess of the amount permitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Administrator determines to be necessary to provide additional power system reserves to meet the region's firm loads.

* (4)(A) As used in this section, the term "existing direct service industrial customer" means any direct service industrial customer of the Administrator which has a contract for the purchase of electric power from the Administrator on December 5, 1980.

* (B) The term "new direct service industrial customer" means any industrial entity other than an existing direct service industrial customer.

Such contract shall also provide that the obligation of the Administrator to acquire such resources to meet such load requirement shall, except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, apply only to such customer and shall not be sold or exchanged by such customer to any other person.

* (ii) Rights under a contract described in clause (i) of this subparagraph may be transferred by an existing direct service industrial customer referred to in clause (i) to a successor in interest in connection with a reorganization or other transfer of all major assets of such customer. Following such a transfer, such successor in interest (or any other subsequent successor in interest) may also transfer rights under such a contract only in connection with a reorganization or other transfer of all assets of such successor in interest.

* (iii) The limitations of clause (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply to any customer referred to in clause (i) whenever the Administrator determines that such customer is receiving electric power pursuant to a contract referred to in such clause (ii).

#### (e) Contractual entitlements to firm power
* (1) The contractual entitlement to firm power of any customer from whom, or on whose behalf, the Administrator has acquired electric power pursuant to section 839d of this title may not be restricted below the amount of electric power so acquired from, or on behalf of, such customer. If in any year such customer's requirements are less than such entitlement, any excess of such entitlement shall be first made available to increase the entitlement of other customers of the same class before being available for the entitlement of other customers. For purposes of this paragraph, the following entities shall each constitute a class:

  * (A) public bodies and cooperatives;

  * (B) Federal agencies;

  * (C) direct service industrial; and

  * (D) investor owned utilities.


* (2) Any contractual entitlement to firm power which is based on electric power acquired from, or on behalf of, a customer pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be in addition to any other contractual entitlement to firm power not subject to restriction that such customer may have under this section. For the purposes of this subsection, references to amounts of power acquired by the Administrator pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be deemed to mean the amounts specified in the resource acquisition contracts exclusive of any amounts recognized in such contracts as replacement for Federal base system resources.

* (3) The Administrator shall, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, insure that any restrictions upon any particular customer class made pursuant to this subsection and subsection (b) of this section are distributed equitably throughout the region.

#### (f) Surplus power

  * (A) publish notice of the proposed action in the Federal Register and provide a copy of such notice to the Council, the Governor of each State in which facilities would be constructed or a conservation measure implemented, and the Administrator's customers;

  * (B) not less than sixty days following publication of such notice, conduct one or more public hearings, presided over by a hearing officer, at which testimony and evidence shall be received, with opportunity for such rebuttal and cross-examination as the hearing officer deems appropriate in the development of an adequate hearing record;

  * (C) develop a record to assist in evaluating the proposal which shall include the transcript of the public hearings, together with exhibits, and such other materials and information as may have been submitted to, or developed by, the Administrator; and

  * (D) following completion of such hearings, promptly provide to the Council and make public a written decision that includes, in addition to a determination respecting the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (f), (h), (l), or (m) of this section, as appropriate—

    * (i) if a plan is in effect, a finding that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the plan or, notwithstanding its inconsistency with the plan, a finding that it is needed to meet the Administrator's obligations under this chapter, or

    * (ii) if no plan is in effect, a finding that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title or notwithstanding its inconsistency, a finding that it is needed to meet the Administrator's obligations under this chapter.


* In the case of subsection (f) of this section, such decision shall be treated as satisfying the applicable requirements of this subsection and of subsection (f) of this section, if it includes a finding of probable consistency, based upon the Administrator's evaluation of information available at the time of completion of the hearing under this paragraph. Such decision shall include the reasons for such finding.


* (2) Within sixty days of the receipt of the Administrator's decision pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, the Council may determine by a majority vote of all members of the Council, and notify the Administrator—

  * (A) that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the plan, or

  * (B) if no plan is in effect, that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title.


* (3) The Administrator may not implement any proposal referred to in paragraph (1) that is determined pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) by either the Administrator or the Council to be inconsistent with the plan or, if no plan is in effect, with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title—

  * (A) unless the Administrator finds that, notwithstanding such inconsistency, such resource is needed to meet the Administrator's obligations under this chapter, and

  * (B) until the expenditure of funds for that purpose has been specifically authorized by Act of Congress enacted after December 5, 1980.


* (4) Before the Administrator implements any proposal referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator shall—

  * (A) submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress the administrative record of the decision (including any determination by the Council under paragraph (2)) and a statement of the procedures followed or to be followed for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.],

  * (B) publish notice of the decision in the Federal Register, and

  * (C) note the proposal in the Administrator's annual or supplementary budget submittal made pursuant to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act (16 U.S.C. 838 and following).


* The Administrator may not implement any such proposal until ninety days after the date on which such proposal has been noted in such budget or after the date on which such decision has been published in the Federal Register, whichever is later.

* (5) The authority of the Council to make a determination under paragraph (2)(B) if no plan is in effect shall expire on the date two years after the establishment of the Council.

#### (d) Acquisition of resources other than major resources
* The Administrator is authorized to acquire a resource, other than a major resource, whether or not such resource meets the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title but which he determines is an experimental, developmental, demonstration, or pilot project of a type with a potential for providing cost-effective service to the region. The Administrator shall make no obligation for the acquisition of such resource until it is included in the annual budgets submitted to the Congress pursuant to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act [16 U.S.C. 838 et seq.].

#### (e) Effectuation of priorities; use of customers and local entities
* (1) In order to effectuate the priority given to conservation measures and renewable resources under this chapter, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make use of his authorities under this chapter to acquire conservation measures and renewable resources, to implement conservation measures, and to provide credits and technical and financial assistance for the development and implementation of such resources and measures (including the funding of, and the securing of debt for, expenses incurred during the investigation and preconstruction of resources, as authorized in subsection (f) of this section).

* (2) To the extent conservation measures or acquisition of resources require direct arrangements with consumers, the Administrator shall make maximum practicable use of customers and local entities capable of administering and carrying out such arrangements.

#### (f) Agreements; investigation and initial development of renewable resources other than major resources; reimbursement of investigation and preconstruction expenses
* (1) For resources which the Administrator determines may be eligible for acquisition under this section and satisfy the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title or, if a plan is in effect, to be consistent with the plan, the Administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with sponsors of—

  * (A) a renewable resource, other than a major resource, to fund or secure debt incurred in the investigation and initial development of such resource, or

  * (B) any other resource to provide for the reimbursement of the sponsor's investigation and preconstruction expenses concerning such resource (which expenses shall not include procurement of capital equipment or construction material for such resource).


* In the case of any resource referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, such reimbursement is authorized only if—

  * (i) such resource is subsequently denied State siting approval or other necessary Federal or State permits, or approvals,

  * (ii) such investigation subsequently demonstrates, as determined by the Administrator, that such resource does not meet the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title or is not acceptable because of environmental impacts, or

  * (iii) after such investigation the Administrator determines not to acquire the resource and the sponsor determines not to construct the resource.


* (2) The Administrator may exercise the authority of this subsection only after he determines that the failure to do so would result in inequitable hardship to the consumers of such sponsors. The Administrator may provide reimbursement under this subsection only for expenses incurred after December 5, 1980.

* (3) Any agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall provide the Administrator an option to acquire any such resource, including a renewable resource, and shall include such other provisions, as the Administrator deems appropriate, for the Administrator's recovery from such sponsors or any assignee of the sponsors, if such sponsor or assignee continues development of the resource, of any advances made by the Administrator pursuant to such agreement.

* (4) The Administrator shall not reimburse any expense incurred by the sponsors (except necessary expenses involved in the liquidation of the resource) after the date of a final denial of application for State siting approval or after the date the Administrator determines that the resource to be inconsistent with the plan or the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title.

#### (g) Environmental impact statements
* At the request of the appropriate State, any environmental impact statement which may be required with respect to a resource, to the extent determined possible by the Administrator in accordance with applicable law and regulations, may be prepared jointly and in coordination with any required environmental impact statement of the State or any other statement which serves the purpose of an environmental impact statement which is required by State law.

#### (h) Billing credits
* (1) If a customer so requests, the Administrator shall grant billing credits to such customer, and provide services to such customer at rates established for such services, for—

  * (A) conservation activities independently undertaken or continued after December 5, 1980, by such customer or political subdivision served by such customer which reduce the obligation of the Administrator that would otherwise have existed to acquire other resources under this chapter, or

  * (B) resources constructed, completed, or acquired after December 5, 1980, by a customer, an entity acting on behalf of such customer, or political subdivision served by the customer which reduce the obligation of the Administrator to acquire resources under this chapter. Such resources shall be renewable resources or multipurpose projects or other resources which are not inconsistent with the plan or, in the absence of a plan, not inconsistent with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title.


* (2) The energy and capacity on which a credit under this subsection to a customer is based shall be the amount by which a conservation activity or resource actually changes the customer's net requirement for supply of electric power or reserves from the Administrator.

* (3) The amount of credits for conservation under this subsection shall be set to credit the customer implementing or continuing the conservation activity for which the credit is granted for the savings resulting from such activity. The rate impact on the Administrator's other customers of granting the credit shall be equal to the rate impact such customers would have experienced had the Administrator been obligated to acquire resources in an amount equal to that actually saved by the activity for which the credit is granted.

* (4) For resources other than conservation, the customer shall be credited for net costs actually incurred by such customer, an entity acting on behalf of such customer, or political subdivision served by such customer, in acquiring, constructing, or operating the resource for which the credit is granted. The rate impact to the Administrator's other customers of granting the credit shall be no greater than the rate impact such customers would have experienced had the Administrator been obligated to acquire resources in an amount equal to that actually produced by the resource for which the credit is granted.

* (5) Retail rate structures which are voluntarily implemented by the Administrator's customers and which induce conservation or installation of consumer-owned renewable resources shall be considered, for purposes of this subsection, to be (A) conservation activities independently undertaken or carried on by such customers, or (B) customer-owned renewable resources, and shall qualify for billing credits upon the same showing as that required for other conservation or renewable resource activities.

* (6) Prior to granting any credit or providing services pursuant to this subsection, the Administrator shall—

  * (A) comply with the notice provisions of subsection (c) of this section, and include in such notice the methodology the Administrator proposes to use in determining the amount of any such credit;

  * (B) include the cost of such credit in the Administrator's annual or amended budget submittal to the Congress made pursuant to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act (16 U.S.C. 838(j)) [16 U.S.C. 838 et seq.];

  * (C) require that resources in excess of customer's reasonable load growth shall have been offered to others for ownership, participation or other sponsorship pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, except in the case of conservation, multi-purpose projects uniquely suitable for development by the customer, or renewable resources; and

  * (D) require that the operators of any generating resource for which a billing credit is to be granted agree to operate such resource in a manner compatible with the planning and operation of the region's power system.

#### (i) Contracts
* Contracts for the acquisition of resources and for billing credits for major resources, including conservation activities, entered into pursuant to this section shall contain such terms and conditions, applicable after the contract is entered into, as will—

  * (1) insure timely construction, scheduling, completion, and operation of resources,

  * (2) insure that the costs of any acquisition are as low as reasonably possible, consistent (A) with sound engineering, operating, and safety practices, and (B) the protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife, including related spawning grounds and habitat affected by the development of such resources, and

  * (3) insure that the Administrator exercises effective oversight, inspection, audit, and review of all aspects of such construction and operation.


* Such contracts shall contain provisions assuring that the Administrator has the authority to approve all costs of, and proposals for, major modifications in construction, scheduling or operations and to assure that the Administrator is provided with such current information as he deems necessary to evaluate such construction and operation.

#### (j) Obligations not to be considered general obligations of United States or secured by full faith and credit of United States
* (1) All contractual and other obligations required to be carried out by the Administrator pursuant to this chapter shall be secured solely by the Administrator's revenues received from the sale of electric power and other services. Such obligations are not, nor shall they be construed to be, general obligations of the United States, nor are such obligations intended to be or are they secured by the full faith and credit of the United States.

* (2) All contracts entered into by the Administrator for the acquisition of resources pursuant to this chapter shall require that, in the sale of any obligations, all offerings and promotional material for the sale of such obligations shall include the language contained in the second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Administrator shall monitor and enforce such requirement.

#### (k) Equitable distribution of benefits
* In the exercise of his authorities pursuant to this section, the Administrator shall, consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the Administrator's obligations to particular customer classes, insure that benefits under this section, including financial and technical assistance, conduct of conservation demonstrations, and experimental projects, services, and billing credits, are distributed equitably throughout the region.

#### (l) Investigations
* (1) The Administrator is authorized and directed to investigate opportunities for adding to the region's resources or reducing the region's power costs through the accelerated or cooperative development of resources located outside the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington if such resources are renewable resources, and are now or in the future planned or considered for eventual development by nonregional agencies or authorities that will or would own, sponsor, or otherwise develop them. The Administrator shall keep the Council fully and currently informed of such investigations, and seek the Council's advice as to the desirability of pursuing such investigations.

* (2) The Administrator is authorized and directed to investigate periodically opportunities for mutually beneficial interregional exchanges of electric power that reduce the need for additional generation or generating capacity in the Pacific Northwest and the regions with which such exchanges may occur. The Council shall take into consideration in formulating a plan such investigations.

* (3) After the Administrator submits a report to Congress pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection, the Administrator is authorized to acquire resources consistent with such investigations and consistent with the plan or, if no plan is in effect, with the priorities of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title. Such acquisitions shall be in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

* (4) The Administrator shall conduct the investigations and the acquisitions, if any, authorized under this subsection with the assistance of other Federal agencies as may be appropriate.

* (5) No later than July 1, 1981, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report of the results of the investigations undertaken pursuant to this subsection, together with the prospects for obtaining additional resources under the authority granted by this subsection and for reductions in generation or generating capacity through exchanges.

#### (m) Offering of reasonable shares to each Pacific Northwest electric utility
* Except as to resources under construction on December 5, 1980, the Administrator shall determine in each case of a major resource acquisition that a reasonable share of the particular resource, or a reasonable equivalent, has been offered to each Pacific Northwest electric utility for ownership, participation, or other sponsorship, but not in excess of the amounts needed to meet such utility's Regional load.

### §839d–1. Federal projects in Pacific Northwest
* Without further appropriation and without fiscal year limitation, the Secretaries of the Interior and Army are authorized to plan, design, construct, operate and maintain generation additions, improvements and replacements, at their respective Federal projects in the Pacific Northwest Region as defined in the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act), Public Law 96–501 (16 U.S.C. 839a(14)), and to operate and maintain the respective Secretary's power facilities in the Region, that the respective Secretary determines necessary or appropriate and that the Bonneville Power Administrator subsequently determines necessary or appropriate, with any funds that the Administrator determines to make available to the respective Secretary for such purposes. Each Secretary is authorized, without further appropriation, to accept and use such funds for such purposes: _Provided_, That, such funds shall continue to be exempt from sequestration pursuant to section 905(g)(1) of title 2: _Provided further_, That this section shall not modify or affect the applicability of any provision of the Northwest Power Act [16 U.S.C. 839 et seq.]. This provision shall be effective on October 1, 1993.

### §839e. Rates
#### (a) Establishment; periodic review and revision; confirmation and approval by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
* (1) The Administrator shall establish, and periodically review and revise, rates for the sale and disposition of electric energy and capacity and for the transmission of non-Federal power. Such rates shall be established and, as appropriate, revised to recover, in accordance with sound business principles, the costs associated with the acquisition, conservation, and transmission of electric power, including the amortization of the Federal investment in the Federal Columbia River Power System (including irrigation costs required to be repaid out of power revenues) over a reasonable period of years and the other costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator pursuant to this chapter and other provisions of law. Such rates shall be established in accordance with sections 9 and 10 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act (16 U.S.C. 838) [16 U.S.C. 838g and 838h], section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 [16 U.S.C. 825s], and the provisions of this chapter.

* (2) Rates established under this section shall become effective only, except in the case of interim rules as provided in subsection (i)(6), upon confirmation and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission upon a finding by the Commission, that such rates—

  * (A) are sufficient to assure repayment of the Federal investment in the Federal Columbia River Power System over a reasonable number of years after first meeting the Administrator's other costs,

  * (B) are based upon the Administrator's total system costs, and

  * (C) insofar as transmission rates are concerned, equitably allocate the costs of the Federal transmission system between Federal and non-Federal power utilizing such system.

#### (b) General application of rates to meet general requirements
* (1) The Administrator shall establish a rate or rates of general application for electric power sold to meet the general requirements of public body, cooperative, and Federal agency customers within the Pacific Northwest, and loads of electric utilities under section 839c(c) of this title. Such rate or rates shall recover the costs of that portion of the Federal base system resources needed to supply such loads until such sales exceed the Federal base system resources. Thereafter, such rate or rates shall recover the cost of additional electric power as needed to supply such loads, first from the electric power acquired by the Administrator under section 839c(c) of this title and then from other resources.

* (2) After July 1, 1985, the projected amounts to be charged for firm power for the combined general requirements of public body, cooperative and Federal agency customers, exclusive of amounts charged such customers under subsection (g) for the costs of conservation, resource and conservation credits, experimental resources and uncontrollable events, may not exceed in total, as determined by the Administrator, during any year after July 1, 1985, plus the ensuing four years, an amount equal to the power costs for general requirements of such customers if, the Administrator assumes that—

  * (A) the public body and cooperative customers' general requirements had included during such five-year period the direct service industrial customer loads which are—

    * (i) served by the Administrator, and

    * (ii) located within or adjacent to the geographic service boundaries of such public bodies and cooperatives;


  * (B) public body, cooperative, and Federal agency customers were served, during such five-year period, with Federal base system resources not obligated to other entities under contracts existing as of December 5, 1980, (during the remaining term of such contracts) excluding obligations to direct service industrial customer loads included in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;

  * (C) no purchases or sales by the Administrator as provided in section 839c(c) of this title were made during such five-year period;

  * (D) all resources that would have been required, during such five-year period, to meet remaining general requirements of the public body, cooperative and Federal agency customers (other than requirements met by the available Federal base system resources determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) were—

    * (i) purchased from such customers by the Administrator pursuant to section 839d of this title, or

    * (ii) not committed to load pursuant to section 839c(b) of this title,


* and were the least expensive resources owned or purchased by public bodies or cooperatives; and any additional needed resources were obtained at the average cost of all other new resources acquired by the Administrator; and

  * (E) the quantifiable monetary savings, during such five-year period, to public body, cooperative and Federal agency customers resulting from—

    * (i) reduced public body and cooperative financing costs as applied to the total amount of resources, other than Federal base system resources, identified under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, and

    * (ii) reserve benefits as a result of the Administrator's actions under this chapter


* were not achieved.


* (3) Any amounts not charged to public body, cooperative, and Federal agency customers by reason of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be recovered through supplemental rate charges for all other power sold by the Administrator to all customers. Rates charged public body, cooperative, or Federal agency customers pursuant to this subsection shall not include any costs or benefits of a net revenue surplus or deficiency occurring for the period ending June 30, 1985, to the extent such surplus or deficiency is caused by—

  * (A) a difference between actual power deliveries and power deliveries projected for the purpose of establishing rates to direct service industrial customers under subsection (c)(1) of this subsection, and

  * (B) an overrecovery or underrecovery of the net costs incurred by the Administrator under section 839c(c) of this title as a result of such difference.


* Any such revenue surplus or deficiency incurred shall be recovered from, or repaid to, customers over a reasonable period of time after July 1, 1985, through a supplemental rate charge or credit applied proportionately for all other power sold by the Administrator at rates established under other subsections of this section prior to July 1, 1985.

* (4) The term "general requirements" as used in this section means the public body, cooperative or Federal agency customer's electric power purchased from the Administrator under section 839c(b) of this title, exclusive of any new large single load.

#### (c) Rates applicable to direct service industrial customers
* (1) The rate or rates applicable to direct service industrial customers shall be established—

  * (A) for the period prior to July 1, 1985, at a level which the Administrator estimates will be sufficient to recover the cost of resources the Administrator determines are required to serve such customers' load and the net costs incurred by the Administrator pursuant to section 839c(c) of this title, based upon the Administrator's projected ability to make power available to such customers pursuant to their contracts, to the extent that such costs are not recovered through rates applicable to other customers; and

  * (B) for the period beginning July 1, 1985, at a level which the Administrator determines to be equitable in relation to the retail rates charged by the public body and cooperative customers to their industrial consumers in the region.


* (2) The determination under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be based upon the Administrator's applicable wholesale rates to such public body and cooperative customers and the typical margins included by such public body and cooperative customers in their retail industrial rates but shall take into account—

  * (A) the comparative size and character of the loads served,

  * (B) the relative costs of electric capacity, energy, transmission, and related delivery facilities provided and other service provisions, and

  * (C) direct and indirect overhead costs,


* all as related to the delivery of power to industrial customers, except that the Administrator's rates during such period shall in no event be less than the rates in effect for the contract year ending on June 30, 1985.

* (3) The Administrator shall adjust such rates to take into account the value of power system reserves made available to the Administrator through his rights to interrupt or curtail service to such direct service industrial customers.

#### (d) Discount rates; special rates
* (1) In order to avoid adverse impacts on retail rates of the Administrator's customers with low system densities, the Administrator shall, to the extent appropriate, apply discounts to the rate or rates for such customers.

* (2) In order to avoid adverse impacts of increased rates pursuant to this chapter on any direct service industrial customer using raw minerals indigenous to the region as its primary resource, the Administrator, upon request of such customer showing such impacts and after considering the effect of such request on his other obligations under this chapter, is authorized, if the Administrator determines that such impacts will be significant, to establish a special rate applicable to such customer if all power sold to such customer may be interrupted, curtailed, or withdrawn to meet firm loads in the region. Such rate shall be established in accordance with this section and shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.

#### (e) Uniform rates; rates for sale of peaking capacity; time-of-day, seasonal, and other rates
* Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Administrator from establishing, in rate schedules of general application, a uniform rate or rates for sale of peaking capacity or from establishing time-of-day, seasonal rates, or other rate forms.

#### (f) Basis for rates
* Rates for all other firm power sold by the Administrator for use in the Pacific Northwest shall be based upon the cost of the portions of Federal base system resources, purchases of power under section 839c(c) of this title and additional resources which, in the determination of the Administrator, are applicable to such sales.

#### (g) Allocation of costs and benefits
* Except to the extent that the allocation of costs and benefits is governed by provisions of law in effect on December 5, 1980, or by other provisions of this section, the Administrator shall equitably allocate to power rates, in accordance with generally accepted ratemaking principles and the provisions of this chapter, all costs and benefits not otherwise allocated under this section, including, but not limited to, conservation, fish and wildlife measures, uncontrollable events, reserves, the excess costs of experimental resources acquired under section 839d of this title, the cost of credits granted pursuant to section 839d of this title, operating services, and the sale of or inability to sell excess electric power.

#### (h) Surcharges
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except the provisions of subsection (a) of this section), the Administrator shall adjust power rates to include any surcharges arising under section 839b(f) of this title, and shall allocate any revenues from such charges in such manner as the Administrator determines will help achieve the purposes of section 839b(f) of this title.

#### (i) Procedures
* In establishing rates under this section, the Administrator shall use the following procedures:

  * (1) Notice of the proposed rates shall be published in the Federal Register with a statement of the justification and reasons supporting such rates. Such notice shall include a date for a hearing in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.

  * (2) One or more hearings shall be conducted as expeditiously as practicable by a hearing officer to develop a full and complete record and to receive public comment in the form of written and oral presentation of views, data, questions, and argument related to such proposed rates. In any such hearing—

    * (A) any person shall be provided an adequate opportunity by the hearing officer to offer refutation or rebuttal of any material submitted by any other person or the Administrator, and

    * (B) the hearing officer, in his discretion, shall allow a reasonable opportunity for cross examination, which, as determined by the hearing officer, is not dilatory, in order to develop information and material relevant to any such proposed rate.


  * (3) In addition to the opportunity to submit oral and written material at the hearings, any written views, data, questions, and arguments submitted by persons prior to, or before the close of, hearings shall be made a part of the administrative record.

  * (4) After such a hearing, the Administrator may propose revised rates, publish such proposed rates in the Federal Register, and conduct additional hearings in accordance with this subsection.

  * (5) The Administrator shall make a final decision establishing a rate or rates based on the record which shall include the hearing transcript, together with exhibits, and such other materials and information as may have been submitted to, or developed by, the Administrator. The decision shall include a full and complete justification of the final rates pursuant to this section.

  * (6) The final decision of the Administrator shall become effective on confirmation and approval of such rates by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section. The Commission shall have the authority, in accordance with such procedures, if any, as the Commission shall promptly establish and make effective within one year after December 5, 1980, to approve the final rate submitted by the Administrator on an interim basis, pending the Commission's final decision in accordance with such subsection. Pending the establishment of such procedures by the Commission, if such procedures are required, the Secretary is authorized to approve such interim rates during such one-year period in accordance with the applicable procedures followed by the Secretary prior to December 5, 1980. Such interim rates, at the discretion of the Secretary, shall continue in effect until July 1, 1982.

#### (j) Cost figures to be indicated on rate schedules and power billings
* All rate schedules adopted, and all power billings rendered, by the Administrator pursuant to this section shall indicate—

  * (1) the approximate cost contribution of different resource categories to the Administrator's rates for the sale of energy and capacity, and

  * (2) the cost of resources acquired to meet load growth within the region and the relation of such cost to the average cost of resources available to the Administrator.

#### (k) Statutory basis for procedures used in establishing rates or rate schedules
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, all rates or rate schedules for the sale of nonfirm electric power within the United States, but outside the region, shall be established after December 5, 1980, by the Administrator in accordance with the procedures of subsection (i) of this section (other than the first sentence of paragraph (6) thereof) and in accordance with the Bonneville Project Act [16 U.S.C. 832 et seq.], the Flood Control Act of 1944, and the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act [16 U.S.C. 838 et seq.]. Notwithstanding section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act [16 U.S.C. 824(f)], such rates or rate schedules shall become effective after review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for conformance with the requirements of such Acts and after approval thereof by the Commission. Such review shall be based on the record of proceedings established under subsection (i) of this section. The parties to such proceedings under subsection (i) shall be afforded an opportunity by the Commission for an additional hearing in accordance with the procedures established for ratemaking by the Commission pursuant to the Federal Power Act [16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.].

#### (l) Rates for sales outside United States; negotiations
* In order to further the purposes of this chapter and to protect the consumers of the region, the Administrator may negotiate, or establish, rates for electric power sold by the Administrator to any entity not located in the United States which shall be equitable in relation to rates for all electric power which is, or may be, purchased by the Administrator or the Administrator's customers from entities outside the United States. In establishing rates other than by negotiation, the provisions of subsection (i) shall apply. In the case of any negotiation with an entity not located in the United States, the Administrator shall provide public notice of any proposal to negotiate such rates. Such negotiated rates shall be not less than the rates established under this chapter for nonfirm power sold within the United States but outside the region. The Administrator shall also afford notice of any rates negotiated pursuant to this subsection.

#### (m) Impact aid payments; formula
* (1) Beginning the first fiscal year after the plan and program required by section 839b(d) and (h) of this title are finally adopted, the Administrator may, subject to the provisions of this section, make annual impact aid payments to the appropriate local governments within the region with respect to major transmission facilities of the Administrator, as defined in section 3(c) of the Federal Columbia River Transmission Act [16 U.S.C. 838a(c)]—

  * (A) which are located within the jurisdictional boundaries of such governments,

  * (B) which are determined by the Administrator to have a substantial impact on such governments, and

  * (C) where the construction of such facilities, or any modification thereof, is completed after December 5, 1980, and, in the case of a modification of an existing facility, such modification substantially increases the capacity of such existing transmission facility.


* (2) Payments made under this subsection for any fiscal year shall be determined by the Administrator pursuant to a regionwide, uniform formula to be established by rule in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (i) of this section. Such rule shall become effective on its approval, after considering its effect on rates established pursuant to this section, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In developing such formula, the Administrator shall identify, and take into account, the local governmental services provided to the Administrator concerning such facilities and the associated costs to such governments as the result of such facilities.

* (3) Payments made pursuant to this subsection shall be made solely from the fund established by section 11 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act [16 U.S.C. 838i]. The provisions of section 13 of such Act [16 U.S.C. 838k], and any appropriations provided to the Administrator under any law, shall not be available for such payments. The authorization of payments under this subsection shall not be construed as an obligation of the United States.

* (4) No payment may be made under this subsection with respect to any land or interests in land owned by the United States within the region and administered by any Federal agency (other than the Administrator), without regard to how the United States obtained ownership thereof, including lands or interests therein acquired or withdrawn by a Federal agency for purposes of such agency and subsequently made available to the Administrator for such facilities.

#### (n) Limiting the inclusion of costs of protection of, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife, within rates charged by the Bonneville Power Administration, to the rate period in which the costs are incurred
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, rates established by the Administrator, under this section shall recover costs for protection, mitigation and enhancement of fish and wildlife, whether under this chapter or any other Act, not to exceed such amounts the Administrator forecasts will be expended during the fiscal year 2002–2006 rate period, while preserving the Administrator's ability to establish appropriate reserves and maintain a high Treasury payment probability for the subsequent rate period.

### §839f. Administrative provisions
#### (a) Contract authority
* Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to contract in accordance with section 2(f) of the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. 832a(f)). Other provisions of law applicable to such contracts on December 5, 1980, shall continue to be applicable.

#### (b) Executive and administrative functions of Administrator of Bonneville Power Administration; sound and businesslike implementation of chapter
* The Administrator shall discharge the executive and administrative functions of his office in accordance with the policy established by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. 832 and following), section 7152(a)(2) and (3) of title 42, and this chapter. The Secretary of Energy, the Council, and the Administrator shall take such steps as are necessary to assure the timely implementation of this chapter in a sound and businesslike manner. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed by the Secretary, the Administrator, or any other official of the Department of Energy to modify, alter, or otherwise affect the requirements and directives expressed by the Congress in section 7152(a)(2) and (3) of title 42 or the operations of such officials as they existed prior to December 5, 1980.

#### (c) Limitations and conditions on contracts for sale or exchange of electric power for use outside Pacific Northwest
* Any contract of the Administrator for the sale or exchange of electric power for use outside the Pacific Northwest shall be subject to limitations and conditions corresponding to those provided in sections 2 and 3 of the Act of August 31, 1964 (16 U.S.C. 837a and 837b) for any contract for the sale, delivery, or exchange of hydroelectric energy or peaking capacity generated within the Pacific Northwest for use outside the Pacific Northwest. In applying such sections for the purposes of this subsection, the term "surplus energy" shall mean electric energy for which there is no market in the Pacific Northwest at any rate established for the disposition of such energy, and the term "surplus peaking capacity" shall mean electric peaking capacity for which there is no demand in the Pacific Northwest at the rate established for the disposition of such capacity. The authority granted, and duties imposed upon, the Secretary by sections 5 and 7 of such Act (16 U.S.C. 837e and 837f) [16 U.S.C. 837d and 837f] shall also apply to the Administrator in connection with resources acquired by the Administrator pursuant to this chapter. The Administrator shall, in making any determination, under any contract executed pursuant to section 839c of this title, of the electric power requirements of any Pacific Northwest customer, which is a non-Federal entity having its own generation, exclude, in addition to hydroelectric generated energy excluded from such requirements pursuant to section 3(d) of such Act (16 U.S.C. 837b(d)), any amount of energy included in the resources of such customer for service to firm loads in the region if (1) such amount was disposed of by such customer outside the region, and (2) as a result of such disposition, the firm energy requirements of such customer or other customers of the Administrator are increased. Such amount of energy shall not be excluded, if the Administrator determines that through reasonable measures such amount of energy could not be conserved or otherwise retained for service to regional loads. The Administrator may sell as replacement for any amount of energy so excluded only energy that would otherwise be surplus.

#### (d) Disposition of power which does not increase amount of firm power Administrator is obligated to provide to any customer
* No restrictions contained in subsection (c) shall limit or interfere with the sale, exchange or other disposition of any power by any utility or group thereof from any existing or new non-Federal resource if such sale, exchange or disposition does not increase the amount of firm power the Administrator would be obligated to provide to any customer. In addition to the directives contained in subsections (i)(1)(B) and (i)(3) and subject to:

  * (1) any contractual obligations of the Administrator,

  * (2) any other obligations under existing law, and

  * (3) the availability of capacity in the Federal transmission system,


* the Administrator shall provide transmission access, load factoring, storage and other services normally attendant thereto to such utilities and shall not discriminate against any utility or group thereof on the basis of independent development of such resource in providing such services.

#### (e) Judicial review; suits
* (1) For purposes of sections 701 through 706 of title 5, the following actions shall be final actions subject to judicial review—

  * (A) adoption of the plan or amendments thereto by the Council under section 839b of this title, adoption of the program by the Council, and any determination by the Council under section 839b(h) of this title;

  * (B) sales, exchanges, and purchases of electric power under section 839c of this title;

  * (C) the Administrator's acquisition of resources under section 839d of this title;

  * (H) any rule prescribed by the Administrator under section 839e(m)(2) of this title.


* (2) The record upon review of such final actions shall be limited to the administrative record compiled in accordance with this chapter. The scope of review of such actions without a hearing or after a hearing shall be governed by section 706 of title 5, except that final determinations regarding rates under section 839e of this title shall be supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record required by section 839e(i) of this title considered as a whole. The scope of review of an action under section 839d(c) of this title shall be governed by section 706 of title 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a hearing pursuant to section 554, 556, or 557 of title 5.

* (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude judicial review of other final actions and decisions by the Council or Administrator.

* (4) For purposes of this subsection—

  * (A) major resources shall be deemed to be acquired upon publication in the Federal Register pursuant to section 839d(c)(4)(B) of this title;

  * (B) resources, other than major resources, shall be deemed to be acquired upon execution of the contract therefor;

  * (C) conservation measures shall be deemed to be implemented upon execution of the contract or grant therefor; and

  * (D) rate determinations pursuant to section 839e of this title shall be deemed final upon confirmation and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.


* (5) Suits to challenge the constitutionality of this chapter, or any action thereunder, final actions and decisions taken pursuant to this chapter by the Administrator or the Council, or the implementation of such final actions, whether brought pursuant to this chapter, the Bonneville Project Act [16 U.S.C. 832 et seq.], the Act of August 31, 1964 (16 U.S.C. 837–837h), or the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act (16 U.S.C. 838 and following), shall be filed in the United States court of appeals for the region. Such suits shall be filed within ninety days of the time such action or decision is deemed final, or, if notice of the action is required by this chapter to be published in the Federal Register, within ninety days from such notice, or be barred. In the case of a challenge of the plan or programs or amendments thereto, such suit shall be filed within sixty days after publication of a notice of such final action in the Federal Register. Such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit brought as provided in this section. The plan and program, as finally adopted or portions thereof, or amendments thereto, shall not thereafter be reviewable as a part of any other action under this chapter or any other law. Suits challenging any other actions under this chapter shall be filed in the appropriate court.

#### (f) Tax treatment of interest on governmental obligations
* For purposes of enabling the Administrator to acquire resources necessary to meet the firm load of public bodies, cooperatives, and Federal agencies from a governmental unit at a cost no greater than the cost which would be applicable in the absence of such acquisition, the exemption from gross income of interest on certain governmental obligations provided in section 103(a)(1) of title 26 shall not be affected by the Administrator's acquisition of such resources if—

  * (1) the Administrator, prior to contracting for such acquisition, certifies to his reasonable belief, that the persons for whom the Administrator is acquiring such resources for sale pursuant to section 839c of this title are public bodies, cooperatives, and Federal agencies, unless the Administrator also certifies that he is unable to acquire such resources without selling a portion thereof to persons who are not exempt persons (as defined in section 103(b) of title 26), and

  * (2) based upon such certification, the Secretary of the Treasury determines in accordance with applicable regulations that less than a major portion of the resource is to be furnished to persons who are not exempt persons (as defined in section 103(b) of title 26).


* The certification under paragraph (1) shall be made in accordance with this subsection and a procedure and methodology approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. For purposes of this subsection, the term "major portion" shall have the meaning provided by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.

#### (g) Review of rates for sale of power to Administrator by investor-owned utility customers
* When reviewing rates for the sale of power to the Administrator by an investor-owned utility customer under section 839c(c) or 839d of this title, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall, in accordance with section 824h of this title—

  * (1) convene a joint State board, and

  * (2) invest such board with such duties and authority as will assist the Commission in its review of such rates.

#### (h) Companies which own or operate facilities for the generation of electricity primarily for sale to Administrator
* (1) No "company" (as defined in section 79b(a)(2) of title 15), which owns or operates facilities for the generation of electricity (together with associated transmission and other facilities) primarily for sale to the Administrator under section 839d of this title shall be deemed an "electric utility company" (as defined in section 79b(a)(3) of title 15), within the meaning of any provision or provisions of chapter 2C of title 15, if at least 90 per centum of the electricity generated by such company is sold to the Administrator under section 839d of this title, and if—

  * (A) the organization of such company is consistent with the policies of section 79a(b) and (c) of title 15, as determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the concurrence of the Administrator, at the time of such organization; and

  * (B) participation in any facilities of such "company" has been offered to public bodies and cooperatives in the region pursuant to section 839d(m) of this title.


* (2) The Administrator shall include in any contract for the acquisition of a major resource from such "company" provisions limiting the amount of equity investment, if any, in such "company" to that which the Administrator determines will be consistent with achieving the lowest attainable power costs attributable to such major resource.

* (3) In the case of any "company" which meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the Administrator, with the concurrence of such Commission, shall approve all significant contracts entered into by, and between, such "company" and any sponsor company or any subsidiary of such sponsor company which are determined to be consistent with the policies of section 79a(b) and (c) of title 15 at the time such contracts are entered into. The Administrator and the Securities and Exchange Commission shall exercise such approval authority within sixty days after receipt of such contracts. Such contracts shall not be effective without such approval.

* (4) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall continue to apply to any such "company" unless the Administrator or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or both, through periodic review, (A) determine at any time that the "company" no longer operates in a manner consistent with the policies of section 79a(b) and (c) of title 15 and in accordance with this subsection, and (B) notify the "company" in writing of such preliminary determination. This subsection shall cease to apply to such "company" thirty days after receipt of notification of a final determination thereof. A final determination shall be made only after public notice of the preliminary determination and after a hearing completed not later than sixty days from the date of publication of such notice. Such final determination shall be made within thirty days after the date of completion of such hearing.

  * (B) dispose of, or assist in the disposal of, any electric power that a customer or group of customers proposes to sell within or without the region at rates and upon terms specified by such customer or group of customers, if such disposition is not in conflict with the Administrator's other marketing obligations and the policies of this chapter and other applicable laws.


* (2) In implementing the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), the Administrator may prescribe policies and conditions for the independent acquisition or disposition of electric power by any direct service industrial customer or group of such customers for the purpose of assuring each direct service industrial customer an opportunity to participate in such acquisition or disposition.

* (3) The Administrator shall furnish services including transmission, storage, and load factoring unless he determines such services cannot be furnished without substantial interference with his power marketing program, applicable operating limitations or existing contractual obligations. The Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, give priority in making such services available for the marketing, within and without the Pacific Northwest, of capability from projects under construction on December 5, 1980, if such capability has been offered for sale at cost, including a reasonable rate of return, to the Administrator pursuant to this chapter and such offer is not accepted within one year.

#### (j) Retail rate designs which encourage conservation and efficient use of electric energy, installation of consumer-owned renewable resources, and rate research and development
* (1) The Council, as soon as practicable after December 5, 1980 shall prepare, in consultation with the Administrator, the customers, appropriate State regulatory bodies, and the public, a report and shall make recommendations with respect to the various retail rate designs which will encourage conservation and efficient use of electric energy and the installation of consumer-owned renewable resources on a cost-effective basis, as well as areas for research and development for possible application to retail utility rates within the region.
