### **CHAPTER 100—NUTRIA ERADICATION AND CONTROL**

### §8101. Findings and purposes
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds the following:

  * (1) Wetlands, tidal marshes, and agricultural lands provide significant cultural, economic, and ecological benefits to the Nation.

  * (2) The South American nutria (Myocastor coypus) is directly contributing to substantial marsh loss on Federal, State, and private land.

  * (3) Traditional harvest methods to control or eradicate nutria have failed. Consequently, marsh loss, loss of public and private wetlands, and loss of agricultural lands are accelerating.

  * (4) The nutria eradication and control pilot program authorized by Public Law 105–322 is to develop new and effective methods for eradication of nutria.

#### (b) Purpose
