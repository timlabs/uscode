### **CHAPTER 63—FEDERAL CAVE RESOURCES PROTECTION**

### §4301. Findings, purposes, and policy
#### (a) Findings
* The Congress finds and declares that—

  * (1) significant caves on Federal lands are an invaluable and irreplaceable part of the Nation's natural heritage; and

  * (2) in some instances, these significant caves are threatened due to improper use, increased recreational demand, urban spread, and a lack of specific statutory protection.

#### (b) Purposes
* The purposes of this chapter are—

  * (1) to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use, enjoyment, and benefit of all people; and

  * (2) to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.

#### (c) Policy
* It is the policy of the United States that Federal lands be managed in a manner which protects and maintains, to the extent practical, significant caves.

* #### (5) Cave resource
  * The term "cave resource" includes any material or substance occurring naturally in caves on Federal lands, such as animal life, plant life, paleontological deposits, sediments, minerals, speleogens, and speleothems.

* #### (6) Secretary
  * The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate.

* #### (7) Speleothem
  * The term "speleothem" means any natural mineral formation or deposit occurring in a cave or lava tube, including but not limited to any stalactite, stalagmite, helictite, cave flower, flowstone, concretion, drapery, rimstone, or formation of clay or mud.

* #### (8) Speleogen
  * The term "speleogen" means relief features on the walls, ceiling, and floor of any cave or lava tube which are part of the surrounding bedrock, including but not limited to anastomoses, scallops, meander niches, petromorphs and rock pendants in solution caves and similar features unique to volcanic caves.

### §4303. Management actions
#### (a) Regulations
* Not later than nine months after November 18, 1988, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. Regulations shall include, but not be limited to, criteria for the identification of significant caves. The Secretaries shall cooperate and consult with one another in preparation of the regulations. To the extent practical, regulations promulgated by the respective Secretaries should be similar.

#### (b) In general
* The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. Those actions shall include (but need not be limited to)—

  * (1) identification of significant caves on Federal lands:

    * (A) The Secretary shall prepare an initial list of significant caves for lands under his jurisdiction not later than one year after the publication of final regulations using the significance criteria defined in such regulations. Such a list shall be developed after consultation with appropriate private sector interests, including cavers.

    * (B) The initial list of significant caves shall be updated periodically, after consultation with appropriate private sector interests, including cavers. The Secretary shall prescribe by policy or regulation the requirements and process by which the initial list will be updated, including management measures to assure that caves under consideration for the list are protected during the period of consideration. Each cave recommended to the Secretary by interested groups for possible inclusion on the list of significant caves shall be considered by the Secretary according to the requirements prescribed pursuant to this paragraph, and shall be added to the list if the Secretary determines that the cave meets the criteria for significance as defined by the regulations.


  * (2) regulation or restriction of use of significant caves, as appropriate;

  * (3) entering into volunteer management agreements with persons of the scientific and recreational caving community; and

  * (4) appointment of appropriate advisory committees.

#### (c) Planning and public participation
* The Secretary shall—

  * (1) ensure that significant caves are considered in the preparation or implementation of any land management plan if the preparation or revision of the plan began after November 18, 1988; and
