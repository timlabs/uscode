### §832. Completion and maintenance of project; generation of electricity
* For the purpose of improving navigation on the Columbia River, and for other purposes incidental thereto, the dam, locks, power plant, and appurtenant works under construction on August 20, 1937, at Bonneville, Oregon and North Bonneville, Washington (called Bonneville project in this chapter), shall be completed, maintained, and operated under the direction of the Secretary of the Army and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers, subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to the powers and duties of the Bonneville power administrator provided for in section 832a(a) of this title (called the administrator in this chapter) respecting the transmission and sale of electric energy generated at said project. The Secretary of the Army shall provide, construct, operate, maintain, and improve at Bonneville project such machinery, equipment, and facilities for the generation of electric energy as the administrator may deem necessary to develop such electric energy as rapidly as markets may be found therefor. The electric energy thus generated and not required for the operation of the dam and locks at such project and the navigation facilities employed in connection therewith shall be delivered to the administrator, for disposition as provided in this chapter.

### §832a. General administrative provisions
#### (a) Appointment of Administrator; powers and duties
* The electric energy generated in the operation of the said Bonneville project shall be disposed of by the said administrator as provided in this chapter. The administrator shall be appointed by the Secretary of Energy; shall be responsible to said Secretary of Energy; and shall maintain his principal office at a place selected by him in the vicinity of the Bonneville project.

* The Administrator shall, as in this chapter provided, make all arrangements for the sale and disposition of electric energy generated at Bonneville project not required for the operation of the dam and locks at such project and the navigation facilities employed in connection therewith. He shall act in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The form of administration established in this chapter for the Bonneville project is intended to be provisional pending the establishment of a permanent administration for Bonneville and other projects in the Columbia River Basin. The Secretary of the Army shall install and maintain additional machinery, equipment, and facilities for the generation of electric energy at the Bonneville project when in the judgment of the administrator such additional generating facilities are desirable to meet actual or potential market requirements for such electric energy. The Secretary of the Army shall schedule the operations of the several electrical generating units and appurtenant equipment of the Bonneville project in accordance with the requirements of the administrator. The Secretary of the Army shall provide and maintain for the use of the administrator at said Bonneville project adequate station space and equipment, including such switches, switchboards, instruments, and dispatching facilities as may be required by the administrator for proper reception, handling, and dispatching of the electric energy produced at the said project, together with transformers and other equipment required by the administrator for the transmission of such energy from that place at suitable voltage to the markets which the administrator desires to serve.

* The office of the Administrator of the Bonneville project is constituted an office in the Department of Energy and shall be under the jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of Energy. All functions vested in the Administrator of the Bonneville project under this chapter may be exercised by the Secretary of Energy and, subject to his supervision and direction, by the Administrator and other personnel of the project.

#### (b) Electric transmission lines and equipment
* In order to encourage the widest possible use of all electric energy that can be generated and marketed and to provide reasonable outlets therefor, and to prevent the monopolization thereof by limited groups, the administrator is authorized and directed to provide, construct, operate, maintain, and improve such electric transmission lines and substations, and facilities and structures appurtenant thereto, as he finds necessary, desirable, or appropriate for the purpose of transmitting electric energy, available for sale, from the Bonneville project to existing and potential markets, and, for the purpose of interchange of electric energy, to interconnect the Bonneville project with other Federal projects and publicly owned power systems constructed on or after August 20, 1937.

#### (c) Acquisition of property
* The administrator is authorized, in the name of the United States, to acquire, by purchase, lease, condemnation, or donation, such real and personal property, or any interest therein, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, franchises, electric transmission lines, substations, and facilities and structures appurtenant thereto, as the administrator finds necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Title to all property and property rights acquired by the administrator shall be taken in the name of the United States.

#### (d) Condemnation
* The administrator shall have power to acquire any property or property rights, including patent rights, which in his opinion are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, by the exercise of the right of eminent domain and to institute condemnation proceedings therefor in the same manner as is provided by law for the condemnation of real estate.

#### (e) Disposal of property
* The administrator is authorized, in the name of the United States, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of such personal property as in his judgment is not required for the purposes of this chapter and such real property and interests in land acquired in connection with construction or operation of electric transmission lines or substations as in his judgment are not required for the purposes of this chapter: _Provided, however_, That before the sale, lease, or disposition of real property or transmission lines, as herein provided, the administrator shall secure the approval of the President of the United States.

#### (f) Contracts
* Subject only to the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to enter into such contracts, agreements, and arrangements, including the amendment, modification, adjustment, or cancelation thereof and the compromise or final settlement of any claim arising thereunder, and to make such expenditures, upon such terms and conditions and in such manner as he may deem necessary.

### §832b. Definitions
* As employed in this chapter, the term "public body", or "public bodies", means States, public power districts, counties, and municipalities, including agencies or subdivisions of any thereof.

* As employed in this chapter, the term "cooperative", or "cooperatives", means any form of nonprofit-making organization or organizations of citizens supplying, or which may be created to supply, members with any kind of goods, commodities, or services, as nearly as possible at cost.

### §832c. Distribution of electricity; preference to public bodies and cooperatives
#### (a) General provisions
* In order to insure that the facilities for the generation of electric energy at the Bonneville project shall be operated for the benefit of the general public, and particularly of domestic and rural consumers, the administrator shall at all times, in disposing of electric energy generated at said project, give preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives.

#### (b) Prior to January 1, 1942; subsequent thereto
* To preserve and protect the preferential rights and priorities of public bodies and cooperatives as provided in section (a) and to effectuate the intent and purpose of this chapter that at all times up to January 1, 1942, there shall be available for sale to public bodies and cooperatives not less than 50 per centum of the electric energy produced at the Bonneville project, it shall be the duty of the administrator in making contracts for the sale of such energy to so arrange such contracts as to make such 50 per centum of such energy available to said public bodies and cooperatives until January 1, 1942: _Provided_, That the electric energy so reserved for but not actually purchased by and delivered to such public bodies and cooperatives prior to January 1, 1942, may be disposed of temporarily so long as such temporary disposition will not interfere with the purchase by and delivery to such public bodies and cooperatives at any time prior to January 1, 1942: _Provided further_, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit or impair the preferential and priority rights of such public bodies or cooperatives after January 1, 1942; and in the event that after such date there shall be conflicting or competing applications for an allocation of electric energy between any public body or cooperative on the one hand and a private agency of any character on the other, the application of such public body or cooperative shall be granted.

#### (c) Allowance of time for financing
* An application by any public body or cooperative for an allocation of electric energy shall not be denied, or another application competing or in conflict therewith be granted, to any private corporation, company, agency, or person, on the ground that any proposed bond or other security issue of any such public body or cooperative, the sale of which is necessary to enable such prospective purchaser to enter into the public business of selling and distributing the electric energy proposed to be purchased, has not been authorized or marketed, until after a reasonable time, to be determined by the administrator, has been afforded such public body or cooperative to have such bond or other security issue authorized or marketed.

#### (d) Congressional declaration of policy; allowance of time for creation and organization
* It is declared to be the policy of the Congress, as expressed in this chapter, to preserve the said preferential status of the public bodies and cooperatives herein referred to, and to give to the people of the States within economic transmission distance of the Bonneville project reasonable opportunity and time to hold any election or elections or take any action necessary to create such public bodies and cooperatives as the laws of such States authorize and permit, and to afford such public bodies or cooperatives reasonable time and opportunity to take any action necessary to authorize the issuance of bonds or to arrange other financing necessary to construct or acquire necessary and desirable electric distribution facilities, and in all other respects legally to become qualified purchasers and distributors of electric energy available under this chapter.

### §832d. Contracts for sale of electricity
#### (a) Authorization of Administrator; contents of contracts
* Subject to the provisions of this chapter and to such rate schedules as the Secretary of Energy may approve, as provided in this chapter, the administrator shall negotiate and enter into contracts for the sale at wholesale of electric energy, either for resale or direct consumption, to public bodies and cooperatives and to private agencies and persons and for the disposition of electric energy to Federal agencies. Contracts for the sale of electric energy to any private person or agency other than a privately owned public utility engaged in selling electric energy to the general public, shall contain a provision forbidding such private purchaser to resell any of such electric energy so purchased to any private utility or agency engaged in the sale of electric energy to the general public, and requiring the immediate canceling of such contract of sale in the event of violation of such provision. Contracts entered into under this subsection shall be binding in accordance with the terms thereof and shall be effective for such period or periods, including renewals or extensions, as may be provided therein, not exceeding in the aggregate twenty years from the respective dates of the making of such contracts. Contracts entered into under this subsection shall contain (1) such provisions as the administrator and purchaser agree upon for the equitable adjustment of rates at appropriate intervals, not less frequently than once in every five years, and (2) in the case of a contract with any purchaser engaged in the business of selling electric energy to the general public, the contract shall provide that the administrator may cancel such contract upon five years' notice in writing if in the judgment of the administrator any part of the electric energy purchased under such contract is likely to be needed to satisfy the requirements of the said public bodies or cooperatives referred to in this chapter, and that such cancelation may be with respect to all or any part of the electric energy so purchased under said contract to the end that the preferential rights and priorities accorded public bodies and cooperatives under this chapter shall at all times be preserved. Contracts entered into with any utility engaged in the sale of electric energy to the general public shall contain such terms and conditions, including among other things stipulations concerning resale and resale rates by any such utility, as the administrator may deem necessary, desirable or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and to insure that resale by such utility to the ultimate consumer shall be at rates which are reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Such contracts shall also require such utility to keep on file in the office of the administrator a schedule of all its rates and charges to the public for electric energy and such alterations and changes therein as may be put into effect by such utility.

#### (b) Exchange of excess power
* The administrator is authorized to enter into contracts with public or private power systems for the mutual exchange of unused excess power upon suitable exchange terms for the purpose of economical operation or of providing emergency or break-down relief.

### §832e. Rate schedules
* Schedules of rates and charges for electric energy produced at the Bonneville project and sold to purchasers as in this chapter provided shall be prepared by the administrator and become effective upon confirmation and approval thereof by the Secretary of Energy; and such rates and charges shall also be applicable to dispositions of electric energy to Federal agencies. Subject to confirmation and approval by the Secretary of Energy, such rate schedules may be modified from time to time by the administrator, and shall be fixed and established with a view to encouraging the widest possible diversified use of electric energy. The said rate schedules may provide for uniform rates or rates uniform throughout prescribed transmission areas in order to extend the benefits of an integrated transmission system and encourage the equitable distribution of the electric energy developed at the Bonneville project.

### §832f. Elements in determining rates
* It is the intent of Congress that rate schedules for the sale of electric energy which is or may be generated at the Bonneville project in excess of the amount required for operating the dam, locks, and appurtenant works at said project shall be determined with due regard to and predicated upon the fact that such electric energy is developed from water power created as an incident to the construction of the dam in the Columbia River at the Bonneville project for the purposes set forth in section 832 of this title. Rate schedules shall be drawn having regard to the recovery (upon the basis of the application of such rate schedules to the capacity of the electric facilities of Bonneville project) of the cost of producing and transmitting such electric energy, including the amortization of the capital investment over a reasonable period of years. Rate schedules shall be based upon an allocation of costs made by the Secretary of Energy. In computing the cost of electric energy developed from water power created as an incident to and a byproduct of the construction of the Bonneville project, the Secretary of Energy may allocate to the costs of electric facilities such a share of the cost of facilities having joint value for the production of electric energy and other purposes as the power development may fairly bear as compared with such other purposes.

### §832g. Purchase of supplies and services
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all purchases and contracts made by the administrator or the Secretary of the Army for supplies or for services except for personal services, shall be made after advertising, in such manner and at such times, sufficiently in advance of opening bids, as the administrator or Secretary of the Army, as the case may be, shall determine to be adequate to insure notice and opportunity for competition. Such advertisement shall not be required, however, when (1) an emergency requires immediate delivery of the supplies or performance of the services; or (2) repair parts, accessories, supplemental equipment, or services are required for supplies or services previously furnished or contracted for; or (3) the aggregate amount involved in any purchase of supplies or procurement of services does not exceed $500; in which cases such purchases of supplies or procurement of services may be made in the open market in the manner common among businessmen. In comparing bids and in making awards, the administrator or the Secretary of the Army, as the case may be, may consider such factors as relative quality and adaptability of supplies or services, the bidder's financial responsibility, skill, experience, record of integrity in dealing, and ability to furnish repairs and maintenance services, the time of delivery or performance offered, and whether the bidder has complied with the specifications.

### §832h. Miscellaneous administrative provisions
#### (a) Accounts; audit; procedures, etc., prescribed
* The administrator, subject to the requirements of the Federal Power Act [16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.], shall keep complete and accurate accounts of operations, including all funds expended and received in connection with transmission and sale of electric energy generated at the Bonneville project, and in the maintenance of such accounts, appropriate obligations shall be established for annual and sick leave of absence as earned.
