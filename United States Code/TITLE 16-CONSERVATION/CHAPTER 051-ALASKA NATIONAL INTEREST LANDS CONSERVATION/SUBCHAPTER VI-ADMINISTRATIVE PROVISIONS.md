* may not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner.

#### (c) Exchanges
* Lands located within the boundaries of a conservation system unit (other than National Forest Wilderness) which are owned by persons or entities other than those described in subsection (b) of this section shall not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner unless prior to final judgment on the value of the acquired land, the owner, after being offered appropriate land of similar characteristics and like value (if such land is available from public lands located outside the boundaries of any conservation system unit), chooses not to accept the exchange. In identifying public lands for exchange pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Alaska Land Use Council.

#### (d) Improved property
* No improved property shall be acquired under subsection (a) without the consent of the owner unless the Secretary first determines that such acquisition is necessary to the fulfillment of the purposes of this Act or to the fulfillment of the purposes for which the concerned conservation system unit was established or expanded.

#### (e) Retained rights
* The owner of an improved property on the date of its acquisition, as a condition of such acquisition, may retain for himself, his heirs and assigns, a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for noncommercial residential or recreational purposes, as the case may be, for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved.

  * (2) property developed for noncommercial recreational uses, together with any structures accessory thereto which were so used on or before January 1, 1980, to the extent that entry onto such property was legal and proper.


* In determining when and to what extent a property is to be considered an "improved property", the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1980, and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed before such date.

#### (g) Consideration of hardship
* The Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by the owner of any property within a conservation system unit to sell such property, if such owner notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.

Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the property exchanged, except that if the parties agree to an exchange and the Secretary determines it is in the public interest, such exchanges may be made for other than equal value.

* (2) Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to convey, by exchange or otherwise, lands or interest in lands within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (other than land validly selected prior to July 28, 1987), without prior approval by Act of Congress.

#### (i) Donation or exchange

### §3193. Use of cabins and other sites of occupancy on conservation system units
#### (a) Improved property on National Park System lands

#### (b) Improved property on other units or areas established or expanded by this Act
* The following conditions shall apply regarding the construction, use and occupancy of cabins and related structures on Federal lands within conservation system units or areas not provided for in subsection (a) of this section:

  * (1) The construction of new cabins is prohibited except as may be authorized pursuant to a nontransferable, five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed use, construction, and maintenance of a cabin is compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established and that the use of the cabin is either directly related to the administration of the unit or area or is necessary to provide for a continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the unit or area where the permit applicant has no reasonable alternative site for constructing a cabin. No special use permit shall be issued to authorize the construction of a cabin for private recreational use.

  * (2) Traditional and customary uses of existing cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area may be allowed to continue in accordance with a nontransferable, renewable five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall be issued only upon a determination that the traditional and customary uses are compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established. No special use permits shall be issued to authorize the use of an existing cabin constructed for private recreational use.

  * (3) No special use permit shall be issued under paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection unless the permit applicant:

Cabins or other structures not under permit shall be used only for official Government business: _Provided, however_, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the unit or area manager, such cabins may be used by the general public.

#### (c) Permits to be renewed for life of claimant and immediate family
* (1) Whenever issuance of a nontransferable renewable five-year special use permit is authorized by subsections (a) or (b) of this section, said permit shall be renewed every five years until the death of the last immediate family member of the claimant residing in the cabin or structure, or unless the Secretary has revoked the special use permit in accordance with the criteria established in this section.

* (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary, after notice and hearing, may revoke a permit provided for in this section if he determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the administrative record as a whole, that the use under the permit is causing or may cause significant detriment to the principal purposes for which the unit was established.

#### (d) Existing cabin leases or permits
* Nothing in this Act shall preclude the renewal or continuation of valid leases or permits in effect on December 2, 1980, for cabins, homesites, or similar structures on Federal lands. Unless the Secretary, or in the case of national forest lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, issues specific findings following notice and an opportunity for the lease-holder or permittee to respond, that renewal or continuation of such valid permit or lease constitutes a direct threat to or a significant impairment to the purposes for which a conservation system unit was established (in the case of a structure located within a conservation system unit) or the public domain or national forest (in case of a structure located outside conservation system units), he shall renew such valid leases or permits upon their expiration in accordance with the provisions of the original lease or permit, subject to such reasonable regulations as he may prescribe. Subject to the provisions of the original lease or permit, nothing in this Act or subsection shall necessarily preclude the appropriate Secretary from transferring such a lease or permit to another person at the election or death of the original permittee or leasee.

Such facilities and equipment shall be constructed, used, and maintained in a manner consistent with the protection of the area in which they are located. All new facilities shall be constructed of materials which blend with, and are compatible with, the immediately surrounding landscape. Upon termination of such activities and uses (but not upon regular or seasonal cessation), such structures or facilities shall, upon written request, be removed from the area by the permittee.

#### (b) Denial of proposed use or establishment
* Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Secretary may determine, after adequate notice, that the establishment and use of such new facilities or equipment would constitute a significant expansion of existing facilities or uses which would be detrimental to the purposes for which the affected conservation system unit was established, including the wilderness character of any wilderness area within such unit, and may thereupon deny such proposed use or establishment.
