### **CHAPTER 40—SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES CONSERVATION**

### §2001. Congressional findings
* The Congress finds that:

* (1) There is a growing demand on the soil, water, and related resources of the Nation to meet present and future needs.

* (2) The Congress, in its concern for sustained use of the resource base of the United States, has ensured that the Department of Agriculture possesses information, technical expertise, and a delivery system for providing assistance to land users with respect to conservation and use of soils; plants; woodlands; watershed protection and flood prevention; the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of water; animal husbandry; fish and wildlife management; recreation; community development; and related resource uses.

* (3) Appraisal and inventory of resources, assessment and inventory of conservation needs, evaluation of the effects of conservation practices, and analyses of alternative approaches to existing conservation programs are basic to effective soil, water, and related natural resource conservation.

* (4) Since individual and governmental decisions concerning soil and water resources often transcend administrative boundaries and affect other programs and decisions, a coordinated appraisal and program framework are essential.

### §2002. Definitions
* As used in this chapter:

* (1) The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

* (2) The term "soil, water, and related resources" means those resources which come within the scope of the programs administered and participated in by the Secretary of Agriculture.

#### (b) Full utilization of cooperative arrangements with State and tribal agencies
* Recognizing that the arrangements under which the Federal Government cooperates with State and tribal soil and water conservation agencies and other appropriate State and tribal natural resource agencies such as those concerned with forestry and fish and wildlife and, through conservation districts, with other local units of government and land users, have effectively aided in the protection and improvement of the Nation's basic resources, including the restoration and maintenance of resources damaged by improper use, it is declared to be the policy of the United States that these arrangements and similar cooperative arrangements should be utilized to the fullest extent practicable to achieve the purpose of this chapter consistent with the roles and responsibilities of the non-Federal agencies, landowners and land users.
