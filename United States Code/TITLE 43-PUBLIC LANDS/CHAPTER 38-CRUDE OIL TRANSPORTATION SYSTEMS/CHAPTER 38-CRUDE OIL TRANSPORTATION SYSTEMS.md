### **CHAPTER 38—CRUDE OIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS**

### §2001. Findings
* The Congress finds and declares that—

  * (1) a serious crude oil supply shortage may soon exist in portions of the United States;

  * (2) a large surplus of crude oil on the west coast of the United States is projected;

  * (3) any substantial curtailment of Canadian crude oil exports to the United States could create a severe crude oil shortage in the northern tier States;

  * (4) pending the authorization and completion of west-to-east crude oil delivery systems, Alaskan crude oil in excess of west coast needs will be transshipped through the Panama Canal at a high transportation cost;

  * (5) national security and regional supply requirements may be such that west-to-east crude delivery systems serving both the northern tier States and inland States, consistent with the requirements of section 410 of the Act approved November 16, 1973 (87 Stat. 594), commonly known as the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, are needed;

  * (6) expeditious Federal and State decisions for west-to-east crude oil delivery systems are of the utmost priority; and

  * (7) resolution of the west coast crude oil surplus and the need for crude oil in northern tier States and inland States require the assignment and coordination of overall responsibility within the executive branch to permit expedited action on all necessary environmental assessments and decisions on permit applications concerning delivery systems.

### §2002. Statement of purposes
* The purposes of this chapter are—

  * (1) to provide a means for—

    * (A) selecting delivery systems to transport Alaskan and other crude oil to northern tier States and inland States, and

    * (B) resolving both the west coast crude oil surplus and the crude oil supply problems in the northern tier States;


  * (2) to provide an expedited procedure for acting on applications for all Federal permits, licenses, and approvals required for the construction and operation or any transportation system approved under this chapter and the Long Beach-Midland project; and

  * (3) to assure that Federal decisions with respect to crude oil transportation systems are coordinated with State decisions to the maximum extent practicable.

### §2003. Definitions
* As used in this chapter—

  * (1) The term "northern tier States" means the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

### §2009. Expedited procedures for issuance of permits: enforcement of rights-of-way
#### (a) Expedited procedures for approved systems
* After issuance of a decision by the President approving any crude oil transportation system, all Federal officers and agencies shall expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with applicable provisions of law, all actions necessary to determine whether to issue, administer, or enforce rights-of-way across Federal lands and to issue Federal permits in connection with, or otherwise to authorize, construction and operation of such system. Any such action shall be consistent with applicable provisions of law. After taking any such action, such officer or agency shall publish notification of the taking of such action in the Federal Register.

#### (b) Expedited procedures for Long Beach-Midland project
* All decisions regarding issuance of Federal permits, rights-of-way, and leases and other Federal authorizations necessary for construction and operation of the Long Beach-Midland project shall be consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law, except that such decisions shall be made within 30 days after the date this chapter becomes effective. The President may extend the date by which such decisions, under the preceding sentence, are to be made to a date not later than 90 days after the effective date of this chapter.
