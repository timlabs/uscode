### §9272. Air Force cross: award

### §9274. Medal of honor; Air Force cross; distinguished-service medal: limitations on award

### §9276. Silver star: award
* The President may award a silver star of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force or the Space Force, is cited for gallantry in action that does not warrant a medal of honor or Air Force cross—
