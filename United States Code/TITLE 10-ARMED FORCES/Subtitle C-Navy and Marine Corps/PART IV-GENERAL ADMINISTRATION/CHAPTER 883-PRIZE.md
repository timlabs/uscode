### **CHAPTER 883—PRIZE**

### §8851. Scope of chapter
* (a) This chapter applies to all captures of vessels as prize during war by authority of the United States or adopted and ratified by the President. However, this chapter does not affect the right of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force, while engaged in hostilities, to capture wherever found and without prize procedure—

  * (1) enemy property; or

  * (2) neutral property used or transported in violation of the obligations of neutrals under international law.


* (b) As used in this chapter—

  * (1) "vessel" includes aircraft; and

  * (2) "master" includes the pilot or other person in command of an aircraft.


* (c) Property seized or taken upon the inland waters of the United States by its naval forces is not maritime prize. All such property shall be delivered promptly to the proper officers of the courts.

* (d) Nothing in this chapter may be construed as contravening any treaty of the United States.

### §8852. Jurisdiction
* (a) The United States district courts have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of each prize and each proceeding for the condemnation of property taken as prize, if the prize is—

  * (1) brought into the United States, or the Commonwealths or possessions;

  * (2) brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent;

  * (3) brought into a locality in the temporary or permanent possession of, or occupied by, the armed forces of the United States; or

  * (4) appropriated for the use of the United States.


* (b) The United States district courts, exclusive of the courts of the States, also have original jurisdiction of a prize cause in which the prize property—

  * (1) is lost or entirely destroyed; or

  * (2) cannot be brought in for adjudication because of its condition.


* (c) The jurisdiction conferred by this section of prizes brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent may not be exercised, nor may prizes be appropriated for the use of the United States within those territorial waters, unless the government having jurisdiction over those waters consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction or to the appropriation.

### §8853. Court in which proceedings brought
* (a) If a prize is brought into a port of the United States, or the Commonwealths or possessions, proceedings for the adjudication of the prize cause shall be brought in the district in which the port is located.

* (b) If a prize is brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent, or is brought into a locality in the temporary or permanent possession of, or occupied by, the armed forces of the United States, or is appropriated for the use of the United States, before proceedings are started, the venue of the proceedings for adjudication of the cause shall be in the judicial district selected by the Attorney General, or his designee, for the convenience of the United States.

* (c) If the prize property is lost or entirely destroyed or if, because of its condition, no part of it has been or can be sent in for adjudication, proceedings for adjudication of the cause may be brought in any district designated by the Secretary of the Navy. In such cases the proceeds of anything sold shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States or public depositary in or nearest the district designated by the Secretary, subject to the orders of the court for that district.

### §8854. Effect of failure to start proceedings
* If a vessel is captured as prize and no proceedings for adjudication are started within a reasonable time, any party claiming the captured property may, in any district court as a court of prize—

  * (1) move for a monition to show cause why such proceedings shall not be started; or

  * (2) bring an original suit for restitution.


* The monition issued in either case shall be served on the United States Attorney for the district, on the Secretary of the Navy, and on such other persons as are designated by order of the court.

### §8855. Appointment of prize commissioners and special prize commissioners
* (a) In each judicial district there may be not more than three prize commissioners, one of whom is the naval prize commissioner. They shall be appointed by the district court for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 8853(a) or (c) of this title. The naval prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is approved by the Secretary of the Navy. The naval prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the prize property. At least one of the other commissioners must be a member of the bar of the court, of not less than three years' standing, who is experienced in taking depositions.

* (b) A district court may appoint special prize commissioners to perform abroad, in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 8853(b) of this title, the duties prescribed for prize commissioners, and, in connection with those causes, to exercise anywhere such additional powers and perform such additional duties as the court considers proper, including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals. The court may determine the number and qualifications of the special prize commissioners it appoints, except that for each cause there shall be at least one naval special prize commissioner.

The department or agency for whose use the prize property is appropriated shall deposit the value of the property with the Treasurer of the United States or with the public depositary nearest to the court in which the proceedings are to be had, subject to the orders of the court.

* (b) Whenever any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize is appropriated for the use of the United States before that property comes into the custody of the prize court, it shall be surveyed, appraised, and inventoried by persons as competent and impartial as can be obtained, and the survey, appraisal, and inventory sent to the court in which the proceedings are to be had. If the property is appropriated after it comes into the custody of the court, sufficient notice shall be given to enable the court to have the property appraised for the protection of the rights of the claimants.

* (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), in any case where prize property is appropriated for the use of the United States, a prize court may adjudicate the cause on the basis of an inventory and survey and an appropriate undertaking by the United States to respond for the value of the property, without either an appraisal or a deposit of the value of the prize with the Treasurer of the United States or a public depositary.

### §8864. Delivery of property on stipulation
* (a) Prize property may be delivered to a claimant on stipulation, deposit, or other security, if—

  * (1) the property has been condemned;

  * (2) the court finds, at any stage of the proceedings, that the property is perishable, liable to deteriorate, or liable to depreciate in value; or

  * (3) the cost of keeping the property is disproportionate to its value.


* (b) The court may order a sale of the prize property if, after the return-day on the libel, all the parties in interest who have appeared in the cause agree to it.

  * (1) prepare and circulate full catalogues and schedules of the property to be sold and return a copy of each to the court;

  * (2) advertise the sale fully and conspicuously by posters and in newspapers ordered by the court;

  * (3) give notice to the naval prize commissioner at least five days before the sale; and

  * (4) keep the goods open for inspection for at least three days before the sale.


* (b) An auctioneer of known skill in the business to which the sale pertains shall be employed by the Secretary of the Navy to make the sale. The auctioneer, or his agent, shall collect and deposit the gross proceeds of the sale. The auctioneer and his agent are responsible to the marshal for the conduct of the sale and the collection and deposit of the gross proceeds.

### §8867. Transfer of prize property to another district for sale
* (a) In the case of any prize property ordered to be sold, if the court believes that it will be in the interest of all parties to have the property sold in a judicial district other than the one in which the proceedings are pending, the court may direct the marshal to transfer the property to the district selected by the court for the sale, and to insure it. In such a case the court shall give the marshal proper orders as to the time and manner of conducting the sale.

* (b) When so ordered the marshal shall transfer the property and keep it safely. He is responsible for its sale in the same manner as if the property were in his own district and for the deposit of the gross proceeds with the Treasurer of the United States or public depositary nearest to the place of sale, subject to the order of the court for the district where the adjudication is pending.

* (c) The necessary expenses of insuring, transferring, receiving, keeping, and selling the property are a charge upon it and upon the proceeds. Whenever any such expense is paid in advance by the marshal, any amount not repaid to him from the proceeds shall be allowed to him as in the case of expenses incurred in suits in which the United States is a party.

* (d) If the Secretary of the Navy believes that it will be in the interest of all parties to have the property sold in a judicial district other than the one in which the proceedings are pending, he may, either by a general regulation or by a special direction in the cause, require the marshal to transfer the property from the district in which the judicial proceedings are pending to any other district for sale. In such a case proceedings shall be had as if the transfer had been made by order of the court.

* (b) When the cause is finally disposed of, the court shall order the Treasurer or public depositary to pay the costs and charges allowed and unpaid. If the final decree is for restitution, or if there is no money subject to the order of the court in the cause, costs or charges allowed by the court and not paid by the claimants shall be paid out of the fund for paying the expenses of suits in which the United States is a party or is interested.

### §8872. Recaptures: award of salvage, costs, and expenses
* (a) If a vessel or other property that has been captured by a force hostile to the United States is recaptured, and the court believes that the property had not been condemned as prize by competent authority before its recapture, the court shall award an appropriate sum as salvage.

* (b) If the recaptured property belonged to the United States, it shall be restored to the United States, and costs and expenses ordered to be paid by the court shall be paid from the Treasury.

* (c) If the recaptured property belonged to any person residing within or under the protection of the United States, the court shall restore the property to its owner upon his claim and on payment of such sum as the court may award as salvage, costs, and expenses.

* (d) If the recaptured property belonged to any person permanently residing within the territory and under the protection of any foreign government in amity with the United States, and, by the law or usage of that government, the property of a citizen of the United States would be restored under like circumstances of recapture, the court shall, upon the owner's claim, restore the property to him under such terms as the law or usage of that government would require of a citizen of the United States under like circumstances. If no such law or usage is known, the property shall be restored upon the payment of such salvage, costs, and expenses as the court orders.

* (e) Amounts awarded as salvage under this section shall be paid to the United States.

### §8873. Allowance of expenses to marshals
* The marshal shall be allowed his actual and necessary expenses for the custody, care, preservation, insurance, and sale or other disposal of the prize property, and for executing any order of the court in the prize cause. Charges of the marshal for expenses or disbursements shall be allowed only upon his oath that they have been necessarily incurred for the purpose stated.

### §8874. Payment of witness fees
* If the court allows fees to any witness in a prize cause, or fees for taking evidence out of the district in which the court sits, and there is no money subject to its order in the cause, the marshal shall pay the fees. He shall be repaid from any money deposited to the order of the court in the cause. Any amount not so repaid to the marshal shall be allowed him as witness fees paid by him in cases in which the United States is a party.

### §8875. Commissions of auctioneers
