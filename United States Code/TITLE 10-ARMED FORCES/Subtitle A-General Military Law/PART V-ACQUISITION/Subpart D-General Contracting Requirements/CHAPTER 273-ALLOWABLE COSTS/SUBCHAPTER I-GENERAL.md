### §3743. Effect of submission of unallowable costs

* (b) PENALTY FOR VIOLATION OF COST PRINCIPLE.—

  * (1) If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to—

    * (A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus

  * (3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that—
