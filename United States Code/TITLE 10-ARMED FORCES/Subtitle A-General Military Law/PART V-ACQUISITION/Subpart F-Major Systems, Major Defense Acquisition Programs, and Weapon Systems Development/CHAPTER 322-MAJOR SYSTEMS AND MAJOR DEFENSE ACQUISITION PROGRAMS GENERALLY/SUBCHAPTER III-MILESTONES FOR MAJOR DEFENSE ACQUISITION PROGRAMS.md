  * (2) the Secretary of the military department concerned and the Chief of the armed force concerned concur in the cost, schedule, technical feasibility, and performance trade-offs that have been made with regard to the program; and

  * (3) there are sound plans for progression of the program or subprogram to the development phase.


* (b) WRITTEN DETERMINATION REQUIRED.—A major defense acquisition program or subprogram may not receive Milestone A approval or otherwise be initiated prior to Milestone B approval until the milestone decision authority determines in writing, after consultation with the Joint Requirements Oversight Council on matters related to program requirements and military needs—

  * (1) that the program fulfills an approved initial capabilities document;

  * (2) that the program has been developed in light of appropriate market research;

  * (3) if the program duplicates a capability already provided by an existing system, the duplication provided by such program is necessary and appropriate;

  * (4) that, with respect to any identified areas of risk, including risks determined by the identification of critical technologies required under section 4272(a)(1) of this title or any other risk assessment, there is a plan to reduce the risk;

  * (5) that planning for sustainment has been addressed and that a determination of applicability of core logistics capabilities requirements has been made;
