  * (1) The cost, schedule, and performance of the program, relative to current metrics, including performance requirements and baseline descriptions.

  * (2) The extent to which the level of program cost, schedule, and performance predicted relative to such metrics is likely to result in the timely delivery of a level of capability to the warfighter that is consistent with the level of resources to be expended and provides superior value to alternative approaches that may be available to meet the same military requirement.


* (d) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSES.—For purposes of this section and sections 4736 and 4377 of this title, a root cause analysis with respect to a major defense acquisition program is an assessment of the underlying cause or causes of shortcomings in cost, schedule, or performance of the program, including the role, if any, of—
