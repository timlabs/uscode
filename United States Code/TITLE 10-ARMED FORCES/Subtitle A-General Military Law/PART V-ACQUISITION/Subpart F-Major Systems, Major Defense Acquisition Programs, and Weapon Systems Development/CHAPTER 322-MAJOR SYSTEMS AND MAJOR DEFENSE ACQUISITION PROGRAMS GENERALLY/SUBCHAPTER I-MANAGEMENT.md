### SUBCHAPTER I—MANAGEMENT

### §4211. Acquisition strategy
* (a) ACQUISITION STRATEGY REQUIRED.—There shall be an acquisition strategy for each major defense acquisition program, each major automated information system, and each major system approved by a milestone decision authority.

* (b) RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL.—For each acquisition strategy required by subsection (a), the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, or the milestone decision authority, when the milestone decision authority is the service acquisition executive of the military department that is managing the program, is responsible for issuing and maintaining the requirements for—

  * (1) the content of the strategy; and

  * (2) the review and approval process for the strategy.


* (c) CONSIDERATIONS.—(1) In issuing requirements for the content of an acquisition strategy for a major defense acquisition program, major automated information system, or major system, the Under Secretary, or the milestone decision authority, when the milestone decision authority is the service acquisition executive of the military department that is managing the program, shall ensure that—

  * (A) the strategy clearly describes the proposed top-level business and technical management approach for the program or system, in sufficient detail to allow the milestone decision authority to assess the viability of the proposed approach, the method of implementing laws and policies, and program objectives;

  * (B) the strategy contains a clear explanation of how the strategy is designed to be implemented with available resources, such as time, funding, and management capacity;

  * (C) the strategy is tailored to address program requirements and constraints; and

  * (D) the strategy considers the items listed in paragraph (2).


* (2) Each strategy shall, where appropriate, consider the following:

  * (B) Acquisition approach, including industrial base considerations in accordance with paragraph (3).

  * (C) Risk management, including such methods as competitive prototyping at the system, subsystem, or component level.

  * (D) Business strategy, including measures to ensure competition at the system and subsystem level throughout the life-cycle of the program or system in accordance with section 4324 of this title.

  * (E) Contracting strategy, including—

    * (i) contract type and how the type selected relates to level of program risk in each acquisition phase;

    * (ii) how the plans for the program or system to reduce risk enable the use of fixed-price elements in subsequent contracts and the timing of the use of those fixed price elements;

    * (iii) market research; and

    * (iv) consideration of small business participation.


  * (F) Intellectual property strategy in accordance with sections 3771 through 3775 of this title.

    * (ii) a critical change to the cost of the program or system;

    * (iii) a significant change to the schedule of the program or system; or

    * (iv) a significant change to the performance of the program or system.


  * (G) Any other time considered relevant by the milestone decision authority.
