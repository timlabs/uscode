### SUBCHAPTER I—MULTIYEAR CONTRACTS FOR ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY

### §3501. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of property: authority; definitions
* (a) IN GENERAL.—To the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation, the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds each of the following:

  * (1) That the use of such a contract will result in significant savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts.

  * (2) That the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities.

  * (3) That there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation.

  * (4) That there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive.

  * (5) That the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are realistic.

  * (6) In the case of a purchase by the Department of Defense, that the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States.

  * (7) In the case of a contract in an amount equal to or greater than $500,000,000, that the conditions required by paragraphs (3) through (6) of section 3507(c) of this title will be met, in accordance with the Secretary's certification and determination under such subsection, by such contract.


* (b) MULTIYEAR CONTRACT DEFINED.—For the purposes of this subchapter, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.

### §3502. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of property: regulations
* (a) REQUIREMENT.—Each official named in subsection (b) shall prescribe acquisition regulations for the agency or agencies under the jurisdiction of such official to promote the use of multiyear contracting as authorized by section 3501 of this title in a manner that will allow the most efficient use of multiyear contracting.

* (b) OFFICIALS SPECIFIED TO PRESCRIBE REGULATIONS.—

  * (1) DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.—The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Department of Defense.

  * (2) COAST GUARD.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Coast Guard, except that the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense shall apply to the Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy.

  * (3) NASA.—The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

### §3503. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of property: contract cancellation or termination
* (a) CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS.—The regulations under section 3502 of this title may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States. The cancellation provisions may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with the production of the items to be delivered under the contract.

* (b) CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION FOR INSUFFICIENT FUNDING.—In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a contract made under this subchapter into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from—

  * (1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;

  * (2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of property concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or

  * (3) funds appropriated for those payments.


* (c) CONTRACT CANCELLATION CEILINGS EXCEEDING $100,000,000.—

  * (1) Before any contract described in section 3501(a) of this title that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the congressional defense committees, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.

  * (2) In the case of a contract described in section 3501(a) of this title with a cancellation ceiling described in paragraph (1), if the budget for the contract does not include proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract, the head of the agency concerned shall, as part of the certification required by section 3507(c) of this title, give written notification to the congressional defense committees of—

    * (A) the cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear procurement contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;

    * (B) the extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and

    * (C) a financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs of contract cancellation.

### §3504. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of property: participation by subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers
* In order to broaden the defense industrial base, the regulations under section 3502 of this title shall provide that, to the extent practicable—

  * (1) multiyear contracting under section 3501(a) of this title shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and

  * (2) upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multiyear contract to any subcontractor, vendor, or supplier company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.

### §3505. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of property: protection of existing authority
* The regulations under section 3502 of this title shall provide that, to the extent practicable, the administration of this subchapter, and of the regulations prescribed under this subchapter, shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of an agency—

  * (4) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic.

  * (5) During the fiscal year in which such contract is to be awarded, sufficient funds will be available to perform the contract in such fiscal year, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation.
