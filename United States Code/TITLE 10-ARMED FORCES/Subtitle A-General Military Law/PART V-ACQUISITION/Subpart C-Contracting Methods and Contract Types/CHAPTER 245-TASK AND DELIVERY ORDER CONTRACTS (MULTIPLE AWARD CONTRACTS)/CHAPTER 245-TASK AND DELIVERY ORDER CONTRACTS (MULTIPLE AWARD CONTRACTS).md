  * (3) WHEN SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS FOR TASK OR DELIVERY ORDER CONTRACTS EXCEEDING $100,000,000 ARE ALLOWED.—(A) Except as provided under subparagraph (B), no task or delivery order contract in an amount estimated to exceed $100,000,000 (including all options) may be awarded to a single source unless the head of the agency determines in writing that—

    * (i) the task or delivery orders expected under the contract are so integrally related that only a single source can efficiently perform the work;

    * (ii) the contract provides only for firm, fixed price task orders or delivery orders for—

      * (II) services for which prices are established in the contract for the specific tasks to be performed;


    * (iii) only one source is qualified and capable of performing the work at a reasonable price to the government; or

    * (iv) because of exceptional circumstances, it is necessary in the public interest to award the contract to a single source.


  * (B) A task or delivery order contract in an amount estimated to exceed $100,000,000 (including all options) may be awarded to a single source without the written determination otherwise required under subparagraph (A) if the head of the agency has made a written determination pursuant to section 3204(a) of this title that procedures other than competitive procedures may be used for the awarding of such contract.

  * (4) REGULATIONS.—The regulations implementing this subsection shall—

    * (A) establish a preference for awarding, to the maximum extent practicable, multiple task or delivery order contracts for the same or similar services or property under the authority of paragraph (1)(B); and

    * (B) establish criteria for determining when award of multiple task or delivery order contracts would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government.


* (e) CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS.—A task or delivery order may not increase the scope, period, or maximum value of the task or delivery order contract under which the order is issued. The scope, period, or maximum value of the contract may be increased only by modification of the contract.

* (f) MULTIPLE AWARDS.—

  * (1) AUTHORITY TO MAKE MULTIPLE AWARDS.—The head of an agency may, on the basis of one solicitation, award separate task order contracts under this section for the same or similar services to two or more sources if the solicitation states that the head of the agency has the option to do so.

  * (2) CONTENT OF SOLICITATION.—If, in the case of a task order contract for advisory and assistance services to be entered into under this section, the contract period is to exceed three years and the contract amount is estimated to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options), the solicitation shall—

    * (A) provide for a multiple award authorized under paragraph (1); and

  * (3) NONAPPLICATION.—Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the task order contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.


* (g) CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS.—

  * (1) INCREASE IN SCOPE, PERIOD, OR MAXIMUM VALUE OF CONTRACT ONLY BY MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT.—A task order may not increase the scope, period, or maximum value of the task order contract under which the order is issued.

    * (A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and

    * (B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.


  * (2) LIMIT OF ONE EXTENSION.—A task order contract may be extended under the authority of paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.


* (i) INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS.—This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and assistance services if the head of an agency entering into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.

* (a) APPLICABILITY.—This section applies to task and delivery order contracts entered into under sections 3403 and 3405 of this title.

* (b) ISSUANCE OF ORDERS.—The following actions are not required for issuance of a task or delivery order under a task or delivery order contract:

  * (2) Except as provided in subsection (c), a competition (or a waiver of competition approved in accordance with section 3204(e) of this title) that is separate from that used for entering into the contract.


* (c) MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACTS.—When multiple task or delivery order contracts are awarded under section 3403(d)(1)(B) or 3405(f) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the contracts unless—

  * (1) the agency's need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;

  * (2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;

  * (3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis;

  * (4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

  * (5) the task or delivery order satisfies one of the exceptions in section 3204(a) of this title to the requirement to use competitive procedures.


* (d) ENHANCED COMPETITION FOR ORDERS IN EXCESS OF $5,000,000.—In the case of a task or delivery order in excess of $5,000,000, the requirement to provide all contractors a fair opportunity to be considered under subsection (c) is not met unless all such contractors are provided, at a minimum—

  * (5) an opportunity for a post-award debriefing consistent with the requirements of section 3304 of this title.


* (e) STATEMENT OF WORK.—A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be delivered under the order.

* (f) PROTESTS.—(1) A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for—

  * (A) a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued; or

  * (B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $25,000,000.


* (2) Notwithstanding section 3556 of title 31, the Comptroller General of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a protest authorized under paragraph (1)(B).

* (g) TASK AND DELIVERY ORDER OMBUDSMAN.—

  * (1) APPOINTMENT OR DESIGNATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES.—Each head of an agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts pursuant to section 3403(d)(1)(B) or 3405(f) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on such contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (c).

  * (2) WHO IS ELIGIBLE.—The task and delivery order ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the agency's competition advocate.
