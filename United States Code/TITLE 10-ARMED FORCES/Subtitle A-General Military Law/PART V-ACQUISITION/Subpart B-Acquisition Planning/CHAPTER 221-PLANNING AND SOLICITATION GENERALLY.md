### §3203. Exclusion of particular source or restriction of solicitation to small business concerns
* (a) EXCLUSION OF PARTICULAR SOURCE.—

  * (1) CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION.—The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by chapter 137 legacy provisions using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the head of the agency determines that to do so—

    * (A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of property or services;

    * (B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;

    * (C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;

    * (D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;

    * (E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or

    * (F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.


  * (2) DETERMINATION FOR CLASS DISALLOWED.—A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.


* (b) EXCLUSION OF OTHER THAN SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.—The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by chapter 137 legacy provisions using competitive procedures, but excluding concerns other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 9 and 15 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638, 644).

* (c) INAPPLICABILITY OF JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS.—A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by section 3204(e)(1) of this title.

### §3204. Use of procedures other than competitive procedures
* (a) WHEN PROCEDURES OTHER THAN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES MAY BE USED.—The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when—

  * (1) the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency;

  * (2) the agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;

  * (3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order—

    * (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization—

    * (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center—

    * (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;


  * (4) the terms of an international agreement or a treaty between the United States and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;

  * (5) subject to section 3201(e) of this title, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial product for authorized resale;

  * (6) the disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or

  * (7) the head of the agency (who may not delegate the authority under this paragraph)—

    * (A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and

    * (B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.


* (b) PROPERTY OR SERVICES CONSIDERED TO BE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE.—For the purposes of applying subsection (a)(1)—

  * (A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a concept—

    * (i) that is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the service; and

    * (ii) the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States, and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and


  * (B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, or the continued provision of highly specialized services, such property or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in—

    * (i) substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition; or

    * (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.


* (c) PROPERTY OR SERVICES NEEDED WITH UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY.—

  * (1) ALLOWABLE CONTRACT PERIOD.—The contract period of a contract described in paragraph (2) that is entered into by an agency pursuant to the authority provided under subsection (a)(2)—

### §3208. Planning for future competition in contracts for major systems
* (a) DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.—

  * (1) DETERMINING WHETHER PROPOSALS ARE NECESSARY.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

  * (2) CONTENTS OF PROPOSALS.—Proposals referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1) are the following:

    * (A) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.

    * (B) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.


* (b) PRODUCTION CONTRACT.—

  * (1) DETERMINING WHETHER PROPOSALS ARE NECESSARY.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

  * (2) CONTENTS OF PROPOSALS.—Proposals referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1) are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:

    * (A) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.

    * (B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.


* (c) CONSIDERATION OF FACTORS AS OBJECTIVES IN NEGOTIATIONS.—If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded. Such objectives may not impair the rights of prospective contractors or subcontractors otherwise provided by law.

* (d) ITEMS DEVELOPED EXCLUSIVELY AT PRIVATE EXPENSE.—

  * (1) LIMITATION.—Whenever the head of an agency requires that proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2) be submitted by an offeror in its offer, the offeror shall not be required to provide a proposal that enables the United States to acquire competitively in the future an identical item if the item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the head of the agency determines that—

    * (A) the original supplier of such item will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or

    * (B) proposals by the original supplier of such item to meet the mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs.


  * (2) EVALUATION.—In considering offers in response to a solicitation requiring proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), the head of an agency shall base any evaluation of items developed exclusively at private expense on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.
