### **CHAPTER 3—GENERAL POWERS AND FUNCTIONS**

### §121. Regulations
* The President may prescribe regulations to carry out his functions, powers, and duties under this title.

### §122. Official registers
* The Secretary of a military department may have published, annually or at such other times as he may designate, official registers containing the names of, and other pertinent information about, such regular and reserve officers of the armed forces under his jurisdiction as he considers appropriate. The register may also contain any other list that the Secretary considers appropriate.

### §122a. Public availability of Department of Defense reports required by law
* (a) IN GENERAL.—To the maximum extent practicable, on or after the date on which each report described in subsection (b) is submitted to Congress, the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, shall ensure that the report is made available to the public by—

  * (1) posting the report on a publicly accessible Internet website of the Department of Defense; and

  * (2) upon request, transmitting the report by other means, as long as such transmission is at no cost to the Department.


* (b) COVERED REPORTS.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a report described in this subsection is any report that is required by law to be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense, or by any element of the Department of Defense.

* (2) A report otherwise described in paragraph (1) is not a report described in this subsection if the report contains—

  * (A) classified information;

  * (B) proprietary information;

  * (C) information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 (commonly referred to as the "Freedom of Information Act"); or

  * (D) any other type of information that the Secretary of Defense determines should not be made available to the public in the interest of national security.

### §123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency
* (a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.

* (b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621–1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.

* (c) If a provision of law pertaining to the promotion of reserve officers is suspended under this section and if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress proposed legislation to adjust the grades and dates of rank of reserve commissioned officers other than commissioned warrant officers, such proposed legislation shall, so far as practicable, be the same as that recommended for adjusting the grades and dates of rank of officers of the regular component of the armed force concerned.

* (d) Upon the termination of a suspension made under the authority of subsection (a) of a provision of law otherwise requiring the separation or retirement of officers on active duty because of age, length of service or length of service in grade, or failure of selection for promotion, the Secretary concerned shall extend by up to 90 days the otherwise required separation or retirement date of any officer covered by the suspended provision whose separation or retirement date, but for the suspension, would have been before the date of the termination of the suspension or within 90 days after the date of such termination.

### §123a. Suspension of end-strength and other strength limitations in time of war or national emergency

Any such waiver may be issued only for a statutory end strength that is prescribed by law before the waiver is issued.

* (2) When a designation of a major disaster or emergency (as those terms are defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)) is in effect, the President may waive any statutory limit that would otherwise apply during the period of the designation on the number of members of a reserve component who are authorized to be on active duty under subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 115(b)(1) of this title, if the President determines the waiver is necessary to provide assistance in responding to the major disaster or emergency.

* (b) TERMINATION OF WAIVER.—(1) Upon the termination of a war or national emergency with respect to which the President has exercised the authority provided by subsection (a)(1), the President may defer the effectiveness of any statutory end strength with respect to the fiscal year during which the termination occurs. Any such deferral may not extend beyond the last day of the sixth month beginning after the date of such termination.

* (2) A waiver granted under subsection (a)(2) shall terminate not later than 90 days after the date on which the designation of the major disaster or emergency that was the basis for the waiver expires.

* (c) STATUTORY END STRENGTH.—In this section, the term "statutory end strength" means any end-strength limitation with respect to a fiscal year that is prescribed by law for any military or civilian component of the armed forces or of the Department of Defense.

* (c) PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.—The President may waive the operation of subsection (a) if the President declares an emergency. The President shall immediately notify Congress of any such waiver.

### §124. Detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs: Department of Defense to be lead agency
* (a) LEAD AGENCY.—(1) The Department of Defense shall serve as the single lead agency of the Federal Government for the detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the United States.

However, except as provided by subsections (b) and (c), a function, power, or duty vested in the Department of Defense, or an officer, official, or agency thereof, by law may not be substantially transferred, reassigned, consolidated, or abolished.
