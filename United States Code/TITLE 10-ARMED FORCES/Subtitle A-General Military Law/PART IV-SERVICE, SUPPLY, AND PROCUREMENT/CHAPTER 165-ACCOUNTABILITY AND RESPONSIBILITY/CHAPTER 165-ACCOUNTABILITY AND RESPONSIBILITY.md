* (b) FINALITY OF ACTION.—(1) Action taken under subsection (a) is final except as provided in paragraph (2).

* (2) An action holding a person pecuniarily liable for loss, spoilage, destruction, or damage is not final until approved by a person designated to do so by the Secretary of a military department, commander of a combatant command, or Director of a Defense Agency, as the case may be, who has jurisdiction of the person held pecuniarily liable. The person designated to provide final approval shall be an officer of an armed force, or a civilian employee, under the jurisdiction of the official making the designation.

* (c) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.

### §2788. Property accountability: regulations
* The Secretary of a military department may prescribe regulations for the accounting for the property of that department and the fixing of responsibility for that property.

### §2789. Individual equipment: unauthorized disposition
* (a) PROHIBITION.—No member of the armed forces may sell, lend, pledge, barter, or give any clothing, arms, or equipment furnished to such member by the United States to any person other than a member of the armed forces or an officer of the United States who is authorized to receive it.

* (b) SEIZURE OF IMPROPERLY DISPOSED PROPERTY.—If a member of the armed forces has disposed of property in violation of subsection (a) and the property is in the possession of a person who is neither a member of the armed forces nor an officer of the United States who is authorized to receive it, that person has no right to or interest in the property, and any civil or military officer of the United States may seize the property, wherever found, subject to applicable regulations. Possession of such property furnished by the United States to a member of the armed forces by a person who is neither a member of the armed forces, nor an officer of the United States, is prima facie evidence that the property has been disposed of in violation of subsection (a).

* (c) DELIVERY OF SEIZED PROPERTY.—If an officer who seizes property under subsection (b) is not authorized to retain it for the United States, the officer shall deliver the property to a person who is authorized to retain it.

### §2790. Recovery of improperly disposed of Department of Defense property
* (a) PROHIBITION.—No member of the armed forces, civilian employee of the United States Government, contractor personnel, or other person may sell, lend, pledge, barter, or give any clothing, arms, articles, equipment, or other military or Department of Defense property except in accordance with the statutes and regulations governing Government property.

* (b) TRANSFER OF TITLE OR INTEREST INEFFECTIVE.—If property has been disposed of in violation of subsection (a), the person holding the property has no right or title to, or interest in, the property.

* (c) AUTHORITY FOR SEIZURE OF IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF PROPERTY.—If any person is in the possession of military or Department of Defense property without right or title to, or interest in, the property because it has been disposed of in material violation of subsection (a), any Federal, State, or local law enforcement official may seize the property wherever found. Unless an exception to the warrant requirement under the fourth amendment to the Constitution applies, seizure may be made only—

  * (1) pursuant to—

    * (A) a warrant issued by the district court of the United States for the district in which the property is located, or for the district in which the person in possession of the property resides or is subject to service; or

    * (B) pursuant to an order by such court, issued after a determination of improper transfer under subsection (e); and


  * (2) after such a court has issued such a warrant or order.


* (d) INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN PROPERTY.—Subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply to—

  * (1) property on public display by public or private collectors or museums in secured exhibits; or

  * (2) property in the collection of any museum or veterans organization or held in a private collection for the purpose of public display, provided that any such property, the possession of which could undermine national security or create a hazard to public health or safety, has been fully demilitarized.


* (e) DETERMINATIONS OF VIOLATIONS.—(1) The district court of the United States for the district in which the property is located, or the district in which the person in possession of the property resides or is subject to service, shall have jurisdiction, regardless of the current approximated or estimated value of the property, to determine whether property was disposed of in violation of subsection (a). Any such determination shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.

* (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of property, the possession of which could undermine national security or create a hazard to public health or safety, the determination under paragraph (1) may be made after the seizure of the property, as long as the United States files an action seeking such determination within 90 days after seizure of the property. If the person from whom the property is seized is found to have been lawfully in possession of the property and the return of the property could undermine national security or create a hazard to public health or safety, the Secretary of Defense shall reimburse the person for the market value for the property.

* (3) Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any firearm, ammunition, or ammunition component, or firearm part or accessory that is not prohibited for commercial sale.

* (f) DELIVERY OF SEIZED PROPERTY.—Any law enforcement official who seizes property under subsection (c) and is not authorized to retain it for the United States shall deliver the property to an authorized member of the armed forces or other authorized official of the Department of Defense or the Department of Justice.

* (g) SCOPE OF ENFORCEMENT.—This section shall apply to the following:

  * (1) Any military or Department of Defense property disposed of after January 6, 2011, in a manner that is not in accordance with statutes and regulations governing Government property in effect at the time of the disposal of such property.

  * (2) Any significant military equipment disposed of on or after January 1, 2002, in a manner that is not in accordance with statutes and regulations governing Government property in effect at the time of the disposal of such significant military equipment.
