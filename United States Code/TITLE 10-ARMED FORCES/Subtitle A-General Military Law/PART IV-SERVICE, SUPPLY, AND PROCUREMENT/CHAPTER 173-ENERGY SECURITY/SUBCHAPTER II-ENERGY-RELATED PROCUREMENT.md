* (e) FUEL SOURCE ANALYSIS.—In order to facilitate the procurement by the Department of Defense of covered fuel under subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may carry out a comprehensive assessment of current and potential locations in the United States for the supply of covered fuel to the Department.

### §2922e. Acquisition of certain fuel sources: authority to waive contract procedures; acquisition by exchange; sales authority
* (a) WAIVER AUTHORITY.—The Secretary of Defense may, for any purchase of a defined fuel source, waive the application of any provision of law prescribing procedures to be followed in the formation of contracts, prescribing terms and conditions to be included in contracts, or regulating the performance of contracts if the Secretary determines—

  * (1) that market conditions for the defined fuel source have adversely affected (or will in the near future adversely affect) the acquisition of that defined fuel source by the Department of Defense; and

  * (2) the waiver will expedite or facilitate the acquisition of that defined fuel source for Government needs.


* (b) SCOPE OF WAIVER.—A waiver under subsection (a) may be made with respect to a particular contract or with respect to classes of contracts. Such a waiver that is applicable to a contract for the purchase of a defined fuel source may also be made applicable to a subcontract under that contract.
