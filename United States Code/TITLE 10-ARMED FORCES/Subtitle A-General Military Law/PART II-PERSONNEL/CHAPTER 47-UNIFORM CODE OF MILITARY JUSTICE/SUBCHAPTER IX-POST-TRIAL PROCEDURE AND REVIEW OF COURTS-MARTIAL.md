The vacation of the suspension of a dismissal is not effective until approved by the Secretary concerned.

* (c) The suspension of any other sentence may be vacated by any authority competent to convene, for the command in which the accused is serving or assigned, a court of the kind that imposed the sentence.

### §873. Art. 73. Petition for a new trial

* (c) If a previously executed sentence of dismissal is not imposed on a new trial, the Secretary concerned shall substitute therefor a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue, and the commissioned officer dismissed by that sentence may be reappointed by the President alone to such commissioned grade and with such rank as in the opinion of the President that former officer would have attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as the President may direct. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right to pay and allowances.

* (d) The President shall prescribe regulations, with such limitations as the President considers appropriate, governing eligibility for pay and allowances for the period after the date on which an executed part of a court-martial sentence is set aside.

* (2) The Attorney General shall take action in accordance with section 4241(d) of title 18.

  * (A) the general court-martial convening authority may commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General; and

  * (B) the Attorney General shall take action in accordance with subsection (e) of section 4243 of title 18.
