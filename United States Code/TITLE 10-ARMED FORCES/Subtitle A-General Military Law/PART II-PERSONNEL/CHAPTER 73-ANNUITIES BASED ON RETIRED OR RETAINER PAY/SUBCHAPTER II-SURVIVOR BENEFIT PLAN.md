    * (B) is determined under subsection (f).

    * (B) who dies before becoming 60 years of age; and

    * (C) who at the time of death is otherwise entitled to retired pay,


* shall be considered to have been entitled to retired pay at the time of death. The retired pay of such person for the purposes of such paragraph shall be computed on the basis of the rates of basic pay in effect on the date on which the annuity provided by such person is to become effective in accordance with the designation of such person under section 1448(e) of this title.


* (c) ANNUITIES FOR SURVIVORS OF CERTAIN PERSONS DYING DURING A PERIOD OF SPECIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR SBP.—

  * (1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of an annuity provided under section 1448(d) or 1448(f) of this title, the amount of the annuity shall be determined as follows:

    * (A) BENEFICIARY UNDER 62 YEARS OF AGE.—If the person receiving the annuity is under 62 years of age or is a dependent child when the member or former member dies, the monthly annuity shall be the amount equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member or former member would have been entitled if the member or former member had been entitled to that pay when he died determined as follows:

      * (i) In the case of an annuity provided under section 1448(d) or 1448(f) of this title (other than in a case covered by clause (ii) or (iii)), such retired pay shall be computed as if the member had been retired under section 1201 of this title on the date of the member's death with a disability rated as total.

      * (ii) In the case of an annuity provided under section 1448(d)(1)(A) of this title by reason of the death of a member not in line of duty, such retired pay shall be computed based upon the member's years of active service when he died.

      * (iii) In the case of an annuity provided under section 1448(f)(1)(A) of this title by reason of the death of a member or former member not in line of duty, such retired pay shall be computed based upon the member or former member's years of service when he died computed under section 12733 of this title.


    * (B) BENEFICIARY 62 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER.—

      * (i) GENERAL RULE.—If the person receiving the annuity (other than a dependent child) is 62 years of age or older when the member or former member dies, the monthly annuity shall be the amount equal to the applicable percent of the retired pay to which the member or former member would have been entitled as determined under subparagraph (A). The percent applicable for a month under the preceding sentence is the percent specified under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i) as being applicable for that month.

      * (ii) RULE IF BENEFICIARY ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSET COMPUTATION.—If the beneficiary is eligible to have the annuity computed under subsection (e) and if computation of the annuity under that subsection is more favorable to the beneficiary than computation under clause (i), the annuity shall be computed under that subsection rather than under clause (i).


  * (2) DIC OFFSET.—An annuity computed under paragraph (1) that is paid to a surviving spouse shall be reduced by a portion (calculated under section 1450(c) of this title) of the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation to which the surviving spouse is entitled under section 1311(a) of title 38. Any such reduction shall be effective on the date of the commencement of the period of payment of such compensation under title 38.

  * (3) SERVICEMEMBERS NOT YET GRANTED RETIRED PAY.—In the case of an annuity provided by reason of the service of a member described in clause (ii) or (iii) of section 1448(d)(1)(A) of this title who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, the retired pay to which the member would have been entitled when he died shall be determined for purposes of paragraph (1) based upon the rate of basic pay in effect at the time of death for the grade in which the member was serving at the time of death, unless (as determined by the Secretary concerned) the member would have been entitled to be retired in a higher grade.

  * (4) RATE OF PAY TO BE USED IN COMPUTING ANNUITY.—In the case of an annuity paid under section 1448(f) of this title by reason of the service of a person who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, the retired pay of the person providing the annuity shall for the purposes of paragraph (1) be computed on the basis of the rates of basic pay in effect on the effective date of the annuity.


* (d) REDUCTION OF ANNUITIES AT AGE 62.—

  * (1) REDUCTION REQUIRED.—The annuity of a person whose annuity is computed under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (c)(1) shall be reduced on the first day of the month after the month in which the person becomes 62 years of age.

  * (2) AMOUNT OF ANNUITY AS REDUCED.—

    * (A) COMPUTATION OF ANNUITY.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the reduced amount of the annuity shall be the amount of the annuity that the person would be receiving on that date if the annuity had initially been computed under subparagraph (B) of that subsection.

    * (B) SAVINGS PROVISION FOR BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSET COMPUTATION.—In the case of a person eligible to have an annuity computed under subsection (e) and for whom, at the time the person becomes 62 years of age, the annuity computed with a reduction under subsection (e)(3) is more favorable than the annuity with a reduction described in subparagraph (A), the reduction in the annuity shall be computed in the same manner as a reduction under subsection (e)(3).


* (e) SAVINGS PROVISION FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES.—

  * (1) PERSONS COVERED.—The following beneficiaries under the Plan are eligible to have an annuity under the Plan computed under this subsection:

    * (A) A beneficiary receiving an annuity under the Plan on October 1, 1985, as the surviving spouse or former spouse of the person providing the annuity.

      * (i) was a participant in the Plan;

      * (ii) was entitled to retired pay or was qualified for that pay except that he had not applied for and been granted that pay; or

  * (2) COORDINATION WHEN PAYMENT OF INCREASE IN RETIRED PAY IS DELAYED BY LAW.—

    * (A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the initial payment of an increase in retired pay under section 1401a of this title (or any other provision of law) to a person is for a month that begins later than the effective date of that increase by reason of the application of subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section (or section 631(b) of Public Law 104–106 (110 Stat. 364)), then the amount of the reduction in the person's retired pay shall be effective on the date of that initial payment of the increase in retired pay rather than the effective date of the increase in retired pay.

    * (B) DELAY NOT TO AFFECT COMPUTATION OF ANNUITY.—Subparagraph (A) may not be construed as delaying, for purposes of determining the amount of a monthly annuity under section 1451 of this title, the effective date of an increase in a base amount under subsection (h) of such section from the effective date of an increase in retired pay under section 1401a of this title to the date on which the initial payment of that increase in retired pay is made in accordance with subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section.


* (i) RECOMPUTATION OF REDUCTION UPON RECOMPUTATION OF RETIRED PAY.—Whenever the retired pay of a person who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after August 1, 1986, and who is a participant in the Plan is recomputed under section 1410 of this title upon the person's becoming 62 years of age, the amount of the reduction in such retired pay under this section shall be recomputed (effective on the effective date of the recomputation of such retired pay under section 1410 of this title) so as to be the amount equal to the amount of such reduction that would be in effect on that date if increases in such retired pay under section 1401a(b) of this title, and increases in reductions in such retired pay under subsection (h), had been computed as provided in paragraph (2) of section 1401a(b) of this title (rather than under paragraph (3) of that section).
