### §1210. Members on temporary disability retired list: periodic physical examination; final determination of status

He may be required to submit to those examinations while his name is carried on that list. If a member fails to report for an examination under this subsection, after receipt of proper notification, his disability retired pay may be terminated. However, payments to him shall be resumed if there was just cause for his failure to report. If payments are so resumed, they may be made retroactive for not more than one year.

* (b) The Secretary concerned shall make a final determination of the case of each member whose name is on the temporary disability retired list upon the expiration of three years after the date when the member's name was placed on that list.

* (f)(1) If, as a result of a periodic examination under subsection (a), or upon a final determination under subsection (b), it is determined that the member is physically fit to perform the duties of his office, grade, rank, or rating, the Secretary shall—

  * (A) treat the member as provided in section 1211 of this title; or

  * (B) discharge the member, retire the member, or transfer the member to the Fleet Reserve, Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, or inactive Reserve under any other law if, under that law, the member—

    * (i) applies for and qualifies for that retirement or transfer; or

    * (ii) is required to be discharged, retired, or eliminated from an active status.


* (2)(A) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(B), a member shall be considered qualified for retirement or transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve or is required to be discharged, retired, or eliminated from an active status if, were the member reappointed or reenlisted under section 1211 of this title, the member would in all other respects be qualified for or would be required to be retired, transferred to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, discharged, or eliminated from an active status under any other provision of law.

* (B) The grade of a member retired, transferred, discharged, or eliminated from an active status pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined under the provisions of law under which the member is retired, transferred, discharged, or eliminated. The member's retired, retainer, severance, readjustment, or separation pay shall be computed as if the member had been reappointed or reenlisted upon removal from the temporary disability retired list and before the retirement, transfer, discharge, or elimination. Notwithstanding section 8301 of title 5, a member who is retired shall be entitled to retired pay effective on the day after the last day on which the member is entitled to disability retired pay.

* (g) Any member of the armed forces whose name is on the temporary disability retired list, and who is required to travel to submit to a physical examination under subsection (a), is entitled to the travel and transportation allowances authorized for members in his retired grade traveling in connection with temporary duty while on active duty.

  * (5) if a commissioned, warrant, or enlisted member of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States when the disability was incurred, and if he cannot be reappointed or reenlisted as a Reserve for service therein, be appointed or enlisted as a Reserve for service in the Army Reserve or the Air Force Reserve, as the case may be, in a grade corresponding to the reserve grade held by him when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, or in the next higher reserve commissioned, warrant, or enlisted grade, as the case may be; and

  * (6) if a member of the Army, or the Air Force, who has no regular or reserve grade, be reappointed or reenlisted in the Army, or the Air Force, as the case may be, in the temporary grade held by him when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, or appointed or enlisted in the next higher temporary grade.

  * (3) if he held a permanent enlisted grade in a regular component when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, be reenlisted in his regular component in the grade permanently held by him when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, or in the next higher enlisted grade;

  * (4) if he was a member of the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, resume his status in the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve in the grade held by him when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, or in the next higher enlisted grade; and

  * (5) if a member of a reserve component be reappointed or reenlisted in his reserve component in the grade permanently held by him when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list or, if that permanent grade is not chief petty officer or master sergeant, in the next higher grade in that reserve component.


* (c) If a member is appointed, reappointed, enlisted, or reenlisted, or resumes his status in the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, under subsection (a) or (b), his status on the temporary disability retired list terminates on the date of his appointment, reappointment, enlistment, reenlistment, or resumption, as the case may be.

The authorized strength in any regular grade is automatically increased to the minimum extent necessary to give effect to each appointment made in that grade under this section. An authorized strength so increased is increased for no other purpose, and while he holds that grade the officer whose appointment caused the increase is counted for the purpose of determining when other appointments, not under this section, may be made in that grade.

* (f) Action under this section shall be taken on a fair and equitable basis, with regard being given to the probable opportunities for advancement and promotion that the member might reasonably have had if his name had not been placed on the temporary disability retired list.

### §1212. Disability severance pay
* (a) Upon separation from his armed force under section 1203 or 1206 of this title, a member is entitled to disability severance pay computed by multiplying (1) the member's years of service computed under section 1208 of this title (subject to the minimum and maximum years of service provided for in subsection (c)), by (2) the highest of the following amounts:

  * (A) Twice the amount of monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving (i) on active duty on the date when he is separated and (ii) in the grade and rank in which he was serving on the date when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, or if his name was not carried on that list, on the date when he is separated.

  * (B) Twice the amount of monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving (i) on active duty on the date when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list or, if his name was not carried on that list, on the date when he is separated, and (ii) in any temporary grade or rank higher than that described in clause (A), in which he served satisfactorily as determined by the Secretary of the military department or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the case may be, having jurisdiction over the armed force from which he is separated.

  * (C) Twice the amount of monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving (i) on active duty on the date when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list or, if his name was not carried on that list, on the date when he is separated, and (ii) in the permanent regular or reserve grade to which he would have been promoted had it not been for the physical disability for which he is separated and which was found to exist as a result of a physical examination.

  * (D) Twice the amount of monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving (i) on active duty on the date when his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list or, if his name was not carried on that list, on the date when he is separated, and (ii) in the temporary grade or rank to which he would have been promoted had it not been for the physical disability for which he is separated and which was found to exist as a result of a physical examination, if his eligibility for promotion was required to be based on cumulative years of service or years in grade.


* (b) For the purposes of subsection (a), a part of a year of active service that is six months or more is counted as a whole year, and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded.

* (c)(1) The minimum years of service of a member for purposes of subsection (a)(1) shall be as follows:

  * (A) Six years in the case of a member separated from the armed forces for a disability incurred in line of duty in a combat zone (as designated by the Secretary of Defense for purposes of this subsection) or incurred during the performance of duty in combat-related operations as designated by the Secretary of Defense.

  * (B) Three years in the case of any other member.


* (2) The maximum years of service of a member for purposes of subsection (a)(1) shall be 19 years.

* (d)(1) The amount of disability severance pay received under this section shall be deducted from any compensation for the same disability to which the former member of the armed forces or his dependents become entitled under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

* (2) No deduction may be made under paragraph (1) in the case of disability severance pay received by a member for a disability incurred in line of duty in a combat zone or incurred during performance of duty in combat-related operations as designated by the Secretary of Defense.

* (3) No deduction may be made under paragraph (1) from any death compensation to which a member's dependents become entitled after the member's death.

### §1213. Effect of separation on benefits and claims
* Unless a person who has received disability severance pay again becomes a member of an armed force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the Public Health Service, he is not entitled to any payment from the armed force from which he was separated for, or arising out of, his service before separation, under any law administered by one of those services or for it by another of those services. However, this section does not prohibit the payment of money to a person who has received disability severance pay, if the money was due him on the date of his separation or if a claim by him is allowed under any law.

### §1214. Right to full and fair hearing
* No member of the armed forces may be retired or separated for physical disability without a full and fair hearing if he demands it.

### §1214a. Members determined fit for duty in Physical Evaluation Board: prohibition on involuntary administrative separation or denial of reenlistment due to unsuitability based on medical conditions considered in evaluation
* (a) DISPOSITION.—Except as provided in subsection (c), the Secretary of the military department concerned may not authorize the involuntary administrative separation of a member described in subsection (b), or deny reenlistment of the member, based on a determination that the member is unsuitable for deployment or worldwide assignment based on the same medical condition of the member considered by a Physical Evaluation Board during the evaluation of the member.

* (b) COVERED MEMBERS.—A member covered by subsection (a) is any member of the armed forces who has been determined by a Physical Evaluation Board pursuant to a physical evaluation by the board to be fit for duty.

* (c) REEVALUATION.—(1) The Secretary of the military department concerned may direct the Physical Evaluation Board to reevaluate any member described in subsection (b) if the Secretary has reason to believe that a medical condition of the member considered by the Physical Evaluation Board during the evaluation of the member described in that subsection renders the member unsuitable for continued military service based on the medical condition.
