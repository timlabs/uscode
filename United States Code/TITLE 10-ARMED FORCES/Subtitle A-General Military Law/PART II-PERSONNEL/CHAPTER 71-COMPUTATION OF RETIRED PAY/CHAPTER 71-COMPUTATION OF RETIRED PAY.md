    * (A) the base index, exceeds

    * (B) the price index for the calendar quarter immediately before the calendar quarter in which the rates of monthly basic pay on which the retired pay is based became effective.

In computing the amount of retired pay to which such a member or former member would have been entitled on that earlier date, the computation shall be based on his grade, length of service, and the rate of basic pay applicable to him at that time, except that such computation may not be based on a rate of basic pay for a grade higher than the grade in which the member is retired. This subsection does not authorize any increase in the monthly retired pay to which a member was entitled for any period before October 7, 1975.

  * (2) PREVENTION OF RETIRED PAY INVERSIONS FOR MEMBERS WITH RETIRED PAY COMPUTED USING HIGH-THREE.—Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the monthly retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980, may not be less, on the date on which the member or former member initially becomes entitled to such pay, than the monthly retired pay to which the member or former member would be entitled on that date if the member or former member had become entitled to retired pay on an earlier date, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. However, in the case of a member or former member whose retired pay is computed subject to section 1407(f) of this title, paragraph (1) (rather than the preceding sentence) shall apply in the same manner as if the member or former member first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, but only with respect to a calculation as of the date on which the member or former member first became entitled to retired pay.

  * (3) PREVENTION OF COLA INVERSIONS.—The percentage of the first adjustment under this section in the retired pay of any person, as determined under subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), (d), or (e), may not exceed the percentage increase in retired pay determined under subsection (b)(2) that is effective on the same date as the effective date of such first adjustment.

For a member who has been entitled to basic pay for a continuous period of at least two years upon that release from active duty, but who is not covered by the preceding sentence, compute under the rates of basic pay replaced by those in effect upon that release from active duty. For any other member, compute under the rates of basic pay under which the member's retired pay or retainer pay was computed when he entered on that active duty.

* <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Before applying percentage factor, credit each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member as one-twelfth of a year and disregard any remaining fractional part of a month.

* <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Before applying percentage factor, credit each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member as one-twelfth of a year and disregard any remaining fractional part of a month.

* If, while on active duty after retirement or after his name was placed on the temporary disability retired list, a member covered by this subsection was promoted to a higher grade in which he served satisfactorily, as determined by the Secretary concerned, he is entitled to retired pay based on the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in that higher grade.

* (e) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a member covered by that subsection may elect, upon his release from active duty, to have his retired pay or retainer pay—

  * (1) computed according to the formula set forth in subsection (a) but using the rate of basic pay under which his retired pay or retainer pay was computed when he entered on active duty; and

  * (2) increased by any applicable adjustments in that pay under section 1401a of this title after he initially became entitled to that pay.


* (f)(1) In the case of a member who is entitled to recompute retired pay under this section upon release from active duty served after retiring under section 7314 or 9314 of this title, the member's retired pay as recomputed under another provision of this section shall be increased by 10 percent of the amount so recomputed if the member has been credited by the Secretary concerned with extraordinary heroism in the line of duty during any period of active duty service in the armed forces.

Upon being provided with such an order, the Secretary shall pay the retained amount in accordance with the order.

* (4)(A) In the event of effective service of a court order under this section and the service of legal process pursuant to section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659), both of which provide for payments during a month from the same member, satisfaction of such court orders and legal process from the retired pay of the member shall be on a first-come, first-served basis. Such court orders and legal process shall be satisfied out of moneys which are subject to such orders and legal process and which remain available in accordance with the limitations of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph during such month after the satisfaction of all court orders or legal process which have been previously served.

* (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total amount of the disposable retired pay of a member payable by the Secretary concerned under all court orders pursuant to this section and all legal processes pursuant to section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659) with respect to a member may not exceed 65 percent of the amount of the retired pay payable to such member that is considered under section 462 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 662) to be remuneration for employment that is payable by the United States.

However, such order shall be considered to be fully satisfied for purposes of this section by the payment to the spouse or former spouse of the maximum amount of disposable retired pay permitted under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4).

* (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a member of liability for the payment of alimony, child support, or other payments required by a court order on the grounds that payments made out of disposable retired pay under this section have been made in the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (1) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4). Any such unsatisfied obligation of a member may be enforced by any means available under law other than the means provided under this section in any case in which the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (1) has been paid and under section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659) in any case in which the maximum amount permitted under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) has been paid.

* (B) If each form of the punishment that would result in the termination of eligibility to receive retired pay is later remitted, set aside, or mitigated to a punishment that does not result in the termination of that eligibility, a payment of benefits to the eligible recipient under this subsection that is based on the punishment so vacated, set aside, or mitigated shall cease. The cessation of payments shall be effective as of the first day of the first month following the month in which the Secretary concerned notifies the recipient of such benefits in writing that payment of the benefits will cease.
