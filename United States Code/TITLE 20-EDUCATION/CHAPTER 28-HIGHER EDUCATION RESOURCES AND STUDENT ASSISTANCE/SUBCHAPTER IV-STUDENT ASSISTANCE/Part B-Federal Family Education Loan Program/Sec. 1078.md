  * (ii) Such portion of the interest on a loan shall not exceed, for any period, the amount of the interest on that loan which is payable by the student after taking into consideration the amount of any interest on that loan which the student is entitled to have paid on his or her behalf for that period under any State or private loan insurance program.

  * (iii) The holder of a loan with respect to which payments are required to be made under this section shall be deemed to have a contractual right, as against the United States, to receive from the Secretary the portion of interest which has been so determined without administrative delay after the receipt by the Secretary of an accurate and complete request for payment pursuant to paragraph (4).

  * (iv) The Secretary shall pay this portion of the interest to the holder of the loan on behalf of and for the account of the borrower at such times as may be specified in regulations in force when the applicable agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) was made, or, if the loan was made by a State or is insured under a program which is not covered by such an agreement, at such times as may be specified in regulations in force at the time the loan was paid to the student.

    * (iii) the Secretary determines that subsection (d) does not make such statutory limitation inapplicable and that such statutory limitation threatens to impede the carrying out of the purpose of this part,

    * (i) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimbursement payments by the Secretary under this subsection exceeds 5 percent of the loans which are insured by such guaranty agency under such program and which were in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection for such excess shall be equal to 85 percent of the amount of such excess; and

    * (ii) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimbursement payments exceeds 9 percent of such loans, the amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection for such excess shall be equal to 75 percent of the amount of such excess.


  * (C) For the purpose of this subsection, the amount of loans of a guaranty agency which are in repayment shall be the original principal amount of loans made by a lender which are insured by such a guaranty agency reduced by—

    * (G) shall prohibit the Secretary from making any reimbursement under this subsection to a guaranty agency when a default claim is based on an inability to locate the borrower, unless the guaranty agency, at the time of filing for reimbursement, certifies to the Secretary that diligent attempts, including contact with the institution, have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and

    * (H) set forth assurances that—

        * (I) under clause (i)(I) shall equal the length of time remaining in the borrower's medical or dental internship or residency program, if the borrower is not eligible to receive a deferment described in such clause, or such length of time remaining in the program after the borrower has exhausted the borrower's eligibility for such deferment;

        * (II) under clause (i)(II) or (IV) shall not exceed 3 years; or

        * (III) under clause (i)(III) shall not exceed the period for which the borrower is serving in a position described in such clause; and

#### (i) Multiple disbursement of loans
* #### (1) Escrow accounts administered by escrow agent
  * Any guaranty agency or eligible lender (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "escrow agent") may enter into an agreement with any other eligible lender that is not an eligible institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "lender") for the purpose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to a student.

Such agreement may allow the lender to make payments into the escrow account in amounts that do not exceed the sum of the amounts required for disbursement of initial or subsequent installments to borrowers and to make such payments not more than 10 days prior to the date of the disbursement of such installment to such borrowers. Such agreement shall require the lender to notify promptly the eligible institution when funds are escrowed under this subsection for a student at such institution.

* #### (1) General requirement
  * In each State, the guaranty agency or an eligible lender in the State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) of this title shall, before July 1, 2010, make loans directly, or through an agreement with an eligible lender or lenders, to eligible students and parents who are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation loans under section 1078–3 of this title) or who attend an institution of higher education in the State that is designated under paragraph (4). Loans made under this subsection shall not exceed the amount of the need of the borrower, as determined under subsection (a)(2)(B), nor be less than $200. No loan under section 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title that is made pursuant to this subsection shall be made with interest rates, origination or default fees, or other terms and conditions that are more favorable to the borrower than the maximum interest rates, origination or default fees, or other terms and conditions applicable to that type of loan under this part. The guaranty agency shall consider the request of any eligible lender, as defined under section 1085(d)(1)(A) of this title, to serve as the lender-of-last-resort pursuant to this subsection.

* #### (2) Rules and operating procedures
  * The guaranty agency shall develop rules and operating procedures for the lender-of-last-resort program designed to ensure that—

    * (A) the program establishes operating hours and methods of application designed to facilitate application by students and ensure a response within 60 days after the student's original complete application is filed under this subsection;

    * (B) consistent with standards established by the Secretary, students applying for loans under this subsection shall not be subject to additional eligibility requirements or requests for additional information beyond what is required under this subchapter in order to receive a loan under this part from an eligible lender, nor, in the case of students and parents applying for loans under this subsection because of an inability to otherwise obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation loans under section 1078–3 of this title), be required to receive more than two rejections from eligible lenders in order to obtain a loan under this subsection;

    * (C) information about the availability of loans under the program is made available to institutions of higher education in the State; and

    * (D) appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers receiving loans under the program are appropriately counseled on their loan obligation.

* #### (3) Advances to guaranty agencies for lender-of-last-resort services
  * (A) In order to ensure the availability of loan capital, the Secretary is authorized to provide a guaranty agency designated for a State with additional advance funds in accordance with subparagraph (C) and section 1072(c)(7) of this title, with such restrictions on the use of such funds as are determined appropriate by the Secretary, in order to ensure that the guaranty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-resort. Such agency shall make such loans in accordance with this subsection and the requirements of the Secretary.

  * (B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a guaranty agency serving as a lender-of-last-resort under this paragraph shall be paid a fee, established by the Secretary, for making such loans in lieu of interest and special allowance subsidies, and shall be required to assign such loans to the Secretary on demand. Upon such assignment, the portion of the advance represented by the loans assigned shall be considered repaid by such guaranty agency.

  * (C) The Secretary shall exercise the authority described in subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that eligible borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under this part or designates an institution of higher education for participation in the program under this subsection under paragraph (4), and that the guaranty agency designated for that State has the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans in a timely manner, in accordance with the guaranty agency's obligations under paragraph (1), but cannot do so without advances provided by the Secretary under this paragraph. If the Secretary makes the determinations described in the preceding sentence and determines that it would be cost-effective to do so, the Secretary may provide advances under this paragraph to such guaranty agency. If the Secretary determines that such guaranty agency does not have such capability, or will not provide such loans in a timely fashion, the Secretary may provide such advances to enable another guaranty agency, that the Secretary determines to have such capability, to make lender-of-last-resort loans to eligible borrowers in that State who are experiencing loan access problems or to eligible borrowers who attend an institution in the State that is designated under paragraph (4).

* #### (4) Institution-wide student qualification
  * Upon the request of an institution of higher education and pursuant to standards developed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall designate such institution for participation in the lender-of-last-resort program under this paragraph. If the Secretary designates an institution under this paragraph, the guaranty agency designated for the State in which the institution is located shall make loans, in the same manner as such loans are made under paragraph (1), to students and parent borrowers of the designated institution, regardless of whether the students or parent borrowers are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this part (other than a consolidation loan under section 1078–3 of this title).

* #### (5) Standards developed by the Secretary
  * In developing standards with respect to paragraph (4), the Secretary may require—

    * (A) an institution of higher education to demonstrate that, despite due diligence on the part of the institution, the institution has been unable to secure the commitment of eligible lenders willing to make loans under this part to a significant number of students attending the institution;

    * (B) that, prior to making a request under such paragraph for designation for participation in the lender-of-last-resort program, an institution of higher education shall demonstrate that the institution has met a minimum threshold, as determined by the Secretary, for the number or percentage of students at such institution who have received rejections from eligible lenders for loans under this part; and

    * (C) any other standards and guidelines the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

* #### (6) Expiration of authority
  * The Secretary's authority under paragraph (4) to designate institutions of higher education for participation in the program under this subsection shall expire on June 30, 2010.

* #### (7) Expiration of designation
  * The eligibility of an institution of higher education, or borrowers from such institution, to participate in the program under this subsection pursuant to a designation of the institution by the Secretary under paragraph (4) shall expire on June 30, 2010. After such date, borrowers from an institution designated under paragraph (4) shall be eligible to participate in the program under this subsection as such program existed on the day before May 7, 2008.

* #### (8) Prohibition on inducements and marketing
  * Each guaranty agency or eligible lender that serves as a lender-of-last-resort under this subsection—

    * (A) shall be subject to the prohibitions on inducements contained in subsection (b)(3) and the requirements of section 1085(d)(5) of this title; and

    * (B) shall not advertise, market, or otherwise promote loans under this subsection, except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a guaranty agency from fulfilling its responsibilities under paragraph (2)(C).
