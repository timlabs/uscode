The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the lender or agency charged, unless the lender or agency has, in the case of a final agency determination, commenced proceedings for judicial review within 90 days of the determination, in which case the deduction may not be made during the pendency of the proceeding.
