  * #### (C) Return of funds
    * Within 90 days after the date of any termination pursuant to subparagraph (A), or the conclusion of any appeal pursuant to subparagraph (B), whichever is later, the balance of the student loan fund established under this part by the institution that is the subject of the termination shall be distributed as follows:

* (D) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.

* (E) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such award year, the institution, in calculating the cohort default rate, shall exclude—

  * (i) any loan on which the borrower has, after the time periods specified in paragraph (2)—

    * (I) voluntarily made 6 consecutive payments;

* #### (4) Special rule
  * A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, because of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the discharged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection shall be treated as an amount canceled under section 1087ee(a) of this title.

    * A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to rehabilitating a loan under this part.

* #### (2) Restoration of eligibility
  * If the borrower of a loan made under this part who has defaulted on that loan makes 6 ontime, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on such loan, the borrower's eligibility for grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter shall be restored to the extent that the borrower is otherwise eligible. A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to restored eligibility.

#### (i) Incentive repayment program
* #### (1) In general
  * Each institution of higher education may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, an incentive repayment program designed to reduce default and to replenish student loan funds established under this part. Each such incentive repayment program may—

    * (A) offer a reduction of the interest rate on a loan on which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly repayments, but in no event may the rate be reduced by more than 1 percent;

The Secretary may not pay interest on such a loan out of any funds other than funds that have been so transferred.

* #### (2) Forbearance
  * During the period in which the Secretary is making payments on a loan under paragraph (1), the institution of higher education shall grant the borrower forbearance in accordance with subsection (e)(1)(C).

#### (k) Additional safeguards
