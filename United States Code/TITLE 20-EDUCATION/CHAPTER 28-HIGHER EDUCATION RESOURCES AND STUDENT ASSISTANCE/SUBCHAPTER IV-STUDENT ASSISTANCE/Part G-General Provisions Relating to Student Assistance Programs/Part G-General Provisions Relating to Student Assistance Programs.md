  * The purpose of the demonstration program under this subsection is to measure the benefits, in terms of student aspirations and plans to attend an institution of higher education, and any adverse effects, in terms of program costs, integrity, distribution, and delivery of aid under this subchapter, of implementing an early application system for all dependent students that allows dependent students to apply for financial aid using information from two years prior to the year of enrollment. Additional objectives associated with implementation of the demonstration program are the following:

    * (A) To measure the feasibility of enabling dependent students to apply for Federal, State, and institutional financial aid in their junior year of secondary school, using information from two years prior to the year of enrollment, by completing any of the forms under this subsection.

    * (B) To identify whether receiving final financial aid award estimates not later than the fall of the senior year of secondary school provides students with additional time to compete for the limited resources available for State and institutional financial aid and positively impacts the college aspirations and plans of these students.

    * (C) To measure the impact of using income information from the years prior to enrollment on—

      * (i) eligibility for financial aid under this subchapter and for other State and institutional aid; and

      * (ii) the cost of financial aid programs under this subchapter.


    * (D) To effectively evaluate the benefits and adverse effects of the demonstration program on program costs, integrity, distribution, and delivery of financial aid.

  * Not later than two years after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall implement an early application demonstration program enabling dependent students who wish to participate in the program—

    * (A) to complete an application under this subsection during the academic year that is two years prior to the year such students plan to enroll in an institution of higher education; and

    * (B) based on the application described in subparagraph (A), to obtain, not later than one year prior to the year of the students' planned enrollment, information on eligibility for Federal Pell Grants, Federal student loans under this subchapter, and State and institutional financial aid for the student's first year of enrollment in the institution of higher education.

* #### (3) Early application and estimated award
  * For all dependent students selected for participation in the demonstration program who submit a completed FAFSA, or, as appropriate, an EZ FAFSA, two years prior to the year such students plan to enroll in an institution of higher education, the Secretary shall, not later than one year prior to the year of such planned enrollment—

    * (A) provide each student who completes an early application with an estimated determination of such student's—

      * (i) expected family contribution for the first year of the student's enrollment in an institution of higher education; and

      * (ii) Federal Pell Grant award for the first such year, based on the Federal Pell Grant amount, determined under section 1070a(b)(2)(A) of this title, for which a student is eligible at the time of application; and


    * (B) remind the students of the need to update the students' information during the calendar year of enrollment using the expedited reapplication process provided for in subsection (a)(4)(A).

    * (A) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;

    * (B) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—

      * (i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data; or

      * (ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer; and


    * (C) whether the data elements collected on the FAFSA that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid, or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs under this subchapter, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.

* #### (2) Report on FAFSA simplification efforts to date
  * Not later than 90 days after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall provide a written report to the authorizing committees on the work the Department has done with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding—

    * (A) how the expected family contribution of a student can be calculated using substantially less income and asset information than was used on March 31, 2008;

    * (B) the extent to which the reduced income and asset information will result in a redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter, State aid, or institutional aid, or in a change in the composition of the group of recipients of such aid, and the amount of such redistribution;

    * (C) how the alternative approaches for calculating the expected family contribution will—

      * (i) rely mainly, in the case of students and parents who file income tax returns, on information available on the 1040, 1040EZ, and 1040A; and

      * (ii) include formulas for adjusting income or asset information to produce similar results to the existing approach with less data;


    * (D) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary of Education income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;

    * (E) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—

      * (i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data; or

      * (ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer;


    * (F) the extent to which the use of income data from two years prior to a student's planned enrollment date will change the expected family contribution computed in accordance with part F, and potential adjustments to the need analysis formula that will minimize the change; and

    * (G) the extent to which the data elements collected on the FAFSA on March 31, 2008, that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.

      * (ii) to identify changes to the statutory need analysis formula that will be necessary to reduce the amount of financial information students and families need to provide to receive a determination of eligibility for student financial aid without causing significant redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter; and

      * (iii) to review State and institutional needs and uses for data collected on the FAFSA, and to determine the best means of addressing such needs in the case of modification of the FAFSA as described in clause (i), or modification of the need analysis formula as described in clause (ii).
