    * For each academic year after academic year 2008–2009, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of income protection allowances for the purpose of sections 1087oo(c)(4) and 1087qq(b)(4) of this title, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C).

  * #### (B) Table for independent students
    * #### (i) Academic years 2009–2010 through 2012–2013
      * For each of the academic years 2009–2010 through 2012–2013, the Secretary shall not develop a revised table of income protection allowances under section 1087qq(b)(4) of this title and the table specified for such academic year under subparagraphs (A) through (D) of such section shall apply.

    * #### (ii) Other academic years
      * For each academic year after academic year 2012–2013, the Secretary shall develop the revised table of income protection allowances by increasing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table of income protection allowances under section 1087qq(b)(4)(D) of this title by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 2011 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to the nearest $10.

  * #### (C) Table for parents
    * For each academic year after academic year 2008–2009, the Secretary shall develop the revised table of income protection allowances under section 1087oo(c)(4) of this title by increasing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to the nearest $10.

#### (c) Adjusted net worth of a farm or business
* For each award year after award year 1993–1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of adjusted net worth of a farm or business for purposes of sections 1087oo(d)(2)(C), 1087pp(c)(2)(C), and 1087qq(c)(2)(C) of this title. Such revised table shall be developed—

  * (1) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to net worth of a farm or business by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such award year, and rounding the result to the nearest $5,000; and

  * (2) by adjusting the dollar amounts "$30,000", "$105,000", and "$195,000" to reflect the changes made pursuant to paragraph (1).

#### (d) Education savings and asset protection allowance
* For each award year after award year 1993–1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of allowances for the purpose of sections 1087oo(d)(3), 1087pp(c)(3), and 1087qq(c)(3) of this title.

For each age cohort below 40, the allowance shall be computed by decreasing the allowance for age 40, as updated, by one-fifteenth for each year of age below age 40 and rounding the result to the nearest $100. In making such determinations—

  * (1) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 percent per year;

  * (1) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to adjusted available income by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, rounded to the nearest $100; and

  * (2) by adjusting the other dollar amounts to reflect the changes made pursuant to paragraph (1).

#### (f) "Consumer Price Index" defined
* As used in this section, the term "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor. Each annual update of tables to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index shall be corrected for misestimation of actual changes in such Index in previous years.

#### (g) State and other tax allowance
* For each award year after award year 1993–1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of State and other tax allowances for the purpose of sections 1087oo(c)(2), 1087oo(g)(3), 1087pp(b)(2), and 1087qq(b)(2) of this title. The Secretary shall develop such revised table after review of the Department of the Treasury's Statistics of Income file and determination of the percentage of income that each State's taxes represent.

#### (h) Employment expense allowance
* For each award year after award year 1993–1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of employment expense allowances for the purpose of sections 1087oo(c)(5), 1087pp(b)(4), and 1087qq(b)(5) of this title. Such revised table shall be developed by increasing the dollar amount specified in sections 1087oo(c)(5)(A), 1087oo(c)(5)(B), 1087pp(b)(4)(A), 1087qq (b)(5)(A), and 1087qq(b)(5)(B) of this title to reflect increases in the amount and percent of the Bureau of Labor Statistics budget of the marginal costs for food away from home, apparel, transportation, and household furnishings and operations for a two-worker versus one-worker family.

### §1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators
#### (a) In general
* Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care or dependent care costs, recent unemployment of a family member or an independent student, a student or family member who is a dislocated worker (as defined in section 3102 of title 29), the number of parents enrolled at least half-time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 1094 of this title, a change in housing status that results in an individual being homeless (as defined in section 11302 of title 42), or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets, or a student's status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases (1) to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter, or (2) to offer a dependent student financial assistance under section 1078–8 of this title or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan without requiring the parents of such student to file the financial aid form prescribed under section 1090 of this title if the student financial aid administrator verifies that the parent or parents of such student have ended financial support of such student and refuse to file such form. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.

#### (b) Adjustments to assets taken into account
* A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) if—

  * (1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or

  * (2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.

#### (c) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications
* On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part B or D, or may certify a loan amount or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in written form to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.

### §1087uu. Disregard of student aid in other Federal programs
* Notwithstanding any other provision of law, student financial assistance received under this subchapter, or under Bureau of Indian Affairs student assistance programs, shall not be taken into account in determining the need or eligibility of any person for benefits or assistance, or the amount of such benefits or assistance, under any Federal, State, or local program financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.

### §1087uu–1. Native American students
* In determining family contributions for Native American students, computations performed pursuant to this part shall exclude—

  * (1) any income and assets of $2,000 or less per individual payment received by the student (and spouse) and student's parents under Public Law 98–64 (25 U.S.C. 117a et seq.; 97 Stat. 365) (commonly known as the "Per Capita Act") or the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act (25 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.); and

  * (2) any income received by the student (and spouse) and student's parents under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 (25 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.).

### §1087uu–2. Special rules for independent students
#### (a) Determination process for unaccompanied homeless youth
* In making a determination of independence under section 1087vv(d)(8) of this title, a financial aid administrator shall comply with the following:

    * (A) a local educational agency homeless liaison, designated pursuant to section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of title 42 or a designee of the liaison;

    * (B) the director of an emergency or transitional shelter, street outreach program, homeless youth drop-in center, or other program serving individuals who are experiencing homelessness, or a designee of the director;

    * (C) the director of a project supported by a Federal TRIO program or a Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate program grant under division 1 or 2 of subpart 2 of part A, or a designee of the director; or

    * (D) a financial aid administrator at another institution who documented the student's circumstance in a prior award year.


  * (2) If a student is unable to provide documentation from any individual described in paragraph (1), make a case-by-case determination, which shall be—

    * (A) based on a written statement from, or a documented interview with, the student that confirms that the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth, or unaccompanied, at risk of homelessness, and self-supporting; and

    * (B) made without regard to the reasons that the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth, or unaccompanied, at risk of homelessness, and self-supporting.


  * (3) Consider a determination made under this subsection as distinct from a determination of independence under section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title.

#### (b) Documentation process for foster care youth
* If an institution requires that a student provide documentation that the student was in foster care when the student was age 13 or older, a financial aid administrator shall consider any of the following as adequate documentation, in the absence of documented conflicting information:

  * (1) Submission of a court order or official State documentation that the student received Federal or State support in foster care.

  * (2) A documented phone call, written statement, or verifiable electronic data match, which confirms the student was in foster care at an applicable age, from—

    * (B) a State Medicaid agency; or

    * (C) a public or private foster care placing agency or foster care facility or placement.


  * (3) A documented phone call or a written statement from an attorney, a guardian ad litem, or a Court Appointed Special Advocate that confirms that the student was in foster care at an applicable age and documents the person's relationship to the student.

#### (c) Timing
* A determination of independence under paragraph (2), (8), or (9) of section 1087vv(d) of this title for a student—

  * (1) shall be made as quickly as practicable;

  * (2) may be made as early as the year before the award year for which the student initially submits an application; and

  * (3) shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of the student's enrollment during the award year for which the student initially submits an application.

#### (d) Use of earlier determinations
* #### (1) Earlier determination by the institution
  * Any student who is determined to be independent under paragraph (2), (8), or (9) of section 1087vv(d) of this title for a preceding award year at an institution shall be presumed to be independent for each subsequent award year at the same institution unless—

    * (A) the student informs the institution that circumstances have changed; or

    * (B) the institution has specific conflicting information about the student's independence and has informed the student of this information.

* #### (2) Earlier determination by another institution
  * A financial aid administrator may make a determination of independence pursuant to section 1087tt(c) of this title, based upon a documented determination of independence that was previously made by another financial aid administrator under such paragraph in the same award year.

#### (e) Retention of documents
* A financial aid administrator shall retain all documents related to any determination of independence, including documented interviews, for at least the duration of the student's enrollment and an additional period prescribed by the Secretary to enable a student to utilize the documents for the purposes of subsection (a)(1)(D), (b)(5), or (d) of this section.

### §1087vv. Definitions

Such simplification may include the sharing of data between the Internal Revenue Service and the Department, pursuant to the consent of the taxpayer.

* (2) No portion of any student financial assistance received from any program by an individual, no portion of veterans' education benefits received by an individual, no portion of a national service educational award or post-service benefit received by an individual under title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12511 et seq.), no portion of any tax credit taken under section 25A of title 26, and no distribution from any qualified education benefit described in subsection (f)(3) that is not subject to Federal income tax, shall be included as income or assets in the computation of expected family contribution for any program funded in whole or in part under this chapter.
