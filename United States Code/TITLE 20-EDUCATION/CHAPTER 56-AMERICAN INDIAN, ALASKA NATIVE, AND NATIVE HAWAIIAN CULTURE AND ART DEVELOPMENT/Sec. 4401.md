  * (3) the enhancement and preservation of this Nation's native art and culture has a fundamental positive influence on the American people;

  * (4) although the encouragement and support of Indian and Native Hawaiian arts and crafts are primarily a matter for private, local, and Indian and Native Hawaiian initiative, it is also an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal Government;
