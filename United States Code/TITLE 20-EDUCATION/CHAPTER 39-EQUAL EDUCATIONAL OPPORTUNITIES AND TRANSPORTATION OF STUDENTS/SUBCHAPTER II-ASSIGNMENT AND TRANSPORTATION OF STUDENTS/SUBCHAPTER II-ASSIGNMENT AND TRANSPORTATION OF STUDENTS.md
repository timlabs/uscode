### §1757. Prohibition of forced busing during school year
#### (a) Congressional findings
* The Congress finds that—

  * (1) the forced transportation of elementary and secondary school students in implementation of the constitutional requirement for the desegregation of such schools is controversial and difficult under the best planning and administration; and

  * (2) the forced transportation of elementary and secondary school students after the commencement of an academic school year is educationally unsound and administratively inefficient.

#### (b) Student transportation orders incidental to student transfers pursuant to school desegregation plans effective beginning with academic school year
* Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no order of a court, department, or agency of the United States, requiring the transportation of any student incident to the transfer of that student from one elementary or secondary school to another such school in a local educational agency pursuant to a plan requiring such transportation for the racial desegregation of any school in that agency, shall be effective until the beginning of an academic school year.

#### (c) "Academic school year" defined
* For the purpose of this section, the term "academic school year" means, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, the customary beginning of classes for the school year at an elementary or secondary school of a local educational agency for a school year that occurs not more often than once in any twelve-month period.

#### (d) Orders subject to provisions of section
* The provisions of this section apply to any order which was not implemented at the beginning of the 1974–1975 academic year.

### §1758. Reasonable time for developing voluntary school desegregation plans following detailed notice of violations
* Notwithstanding any other law or provision of law, no court or officer of the United States shall enter, as a remedy for a denial of equal educational opportunity or a denial of equal protection of the laws, any order for enforcement of a plan of desegregation or modification of a court-approved plan, until such time as the local educational agency to be affected by such order has been provided notice of the details of the violation and given a reasonable opportunity to develop a voluntary remedial plan. Such time shall permit the local educational agency sufficient opportunity for community participation in the development of a remedial plan.
