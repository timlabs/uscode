#### (f) Deficiency dividends
* #### (1) Definition
  * For purposes of this section, the term "deficiency dividends" means a distribution of property made by the qualified investment entity on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (g), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists if distributed during such taxable year. No distribution of property shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination, and unless a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction with respect to such distribution is filed pursuant to subsection (g).

* #### (2) Limitations
  * #### (A) Ordinary dividends
    * The amount of deficiency dividends (other than deficiency dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends) paid by a qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists shall not exceed the sum of—

      * (i) the excess of the amount of increase referred to in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies) over the amount of any increase in the deduction for dividends paid (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) for such taxable year which results from such determination, and

      * (ii) the amount of decrease referred to in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies).

  * #### (B) Capital gain dividends
    * The amount of deficiency dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends paid by a qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists shall not exceed the amount by which (i) the increase referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies), exceeds (ii) the amount of any dividends paid during such taxable year which are designated or reported (as the case may be) as capital gain dividends after such determination.

* #### (3) Effect on dividends paid deduction
  * #### (A) For taxable year in which paid
    * Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year.

  * #### (B) For prior taxable year
    * Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be allowed for purposes of section 855(a) or 858(a) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.

#### (g) Claim required
* No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefore is filed within 120 days after the date of the determination.

#### (h) Suspension of statute of limitations and stay of collection
* #### (1) Suspension of running of statute
  * If the qualified investment entity files a claim as provided in subsection (g), the running of the statute of limitations provided in section 6501 on the making of assessments, and the bringing of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of the deficiency established by a determination under this section, and all interest, additions to tax, additional amounts, or assessable penalties in respect thereof, shall be suspended for a period of 2 years after the date of the determination.

* #### (2) Stay of collection
  * In the case of any deficiency established by a determination under this section—

* No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the collection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.

#### (i) Deduction denied in case of fraud
* No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the determination contains a finding that any part of any deficiency attributable to an adjustment with respect to the taxable year is due to fraud with intent to evade tax or to willful failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.
