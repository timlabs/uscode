### §385. Treatment of certain interests in corporations as stock or indebtedness
#### (a) Authority to prescribe regulations
* The Secretary is authorized to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated for purposes of this title as stock or indebtedness (or as in part stock and in part indebtedness).

#### (b) Factors
* The regulations prescribed under this section shall set forth factors which are to be taken into account in determining with respect to a particular factual situation whether a debtor-creditor relationship exists or a corporation-shareholder relationship exists. The factors so set forth in the regulations may include among other factors:

  * (1) whether there is a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in money in return for an adequate consideration in money or money's worth, and to pay a fixed rate of interest,

  * (2) whether there is subordination to or preference over any indebtedness of the corporation,

  * (3) the ratio of debt to equity of the corporation,

  * (4) whether there is convertibility into the stock of the corporation, and

  * (5) the relationship between holdings of stock in the corporation and holdings of the interest in question.

#### (c) Effect of classification by issuer
* #### (1) In general
  * The characterization (as of the time of issuance) by the issuer as to whether an interest in a corporation is stock or indebtedness shall be binding on such issuer and on all holders of such interest (but shall not be binding on the Secretary).

* #### (2) Notification of inconsistent treatment
  * Except as provided in regulations, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any holder of an interest if such holder on his return discloses that he is treating such interest in a manner inconsistent with the characterization referred to in paragraph (1).

* #### (3) Regulations
  * The Secretary is authorized to require such information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
