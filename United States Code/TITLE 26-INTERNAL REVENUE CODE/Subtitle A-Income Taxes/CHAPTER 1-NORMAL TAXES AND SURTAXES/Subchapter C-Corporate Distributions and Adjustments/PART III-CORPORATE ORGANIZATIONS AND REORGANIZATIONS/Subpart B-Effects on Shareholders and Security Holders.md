  * #### (A) Distributions of a real estate investment trust by another real estate investment trust
    * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any distribution if, immediately after the distribution, the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation are both real estate investment trusts.

  * #### (B) Distributions of certain taxable REIT subsidiaries
    * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any distribution if—

      * (i) the distributing corporation has been a real estate investment trust at all times during the 3-year period ending on the date of such distribution,

      * (ii) the controlled corporation has been a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined in section 856(l)) of the distributing corporation at all times during such period, and

      * (iii) the distributing corporation had control (as defined in section 368(c) applied by taking into account stock owned directly or indirectly, including through one or more corporations or partnerships, by the distributing corporation) of the controlled corporation at all times during such period.


  * A controlled corporation will be treated as meeting the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) if the stock of such corporation was distributed by a taxable REIT subsidiary in a transaction to which this section (or so much of section 356 as relates to this section) applies and the assets of such corporation consist solely of the stock or assets held by one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries of the distributing corporation meeting the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii). For purposes of clause (iii), control of a partnership means ownership of at least 80 percent of the profits interest and at least 80 percent of the capital interests.

### §356. Receipt of additional consideration
#### (a) Gain on exchanges
* #### (1) Recognition of gain
  * If—

    * (A) section 354 or 355 would apply to an exchange but for the fact that

    * (B) the property received in the exchange consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the recognition of gain but also of other property or money,


* then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property.

* #### (2) Treatment as dividend
  * If an exchange is described in paragraph (1) but has the effect of the distribution of a dividend (determined with the application of section 318(a)), then there shall be treated as a dividend to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) as is not in excess of his ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be treated as gain from the exchange of property.

#### (b) Additional consideration received in certain distributions
* If—

  * (1) section 355 would apply to a distribution but for the fact that

  * (2) the property received in the distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 355 to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money,


* then an amount equal to the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.

#### (c) Loss
* If—

  * (1) section 354 would apply to an exchange or section 355 would apply to an exchange or distribution, but for the fact that

  * (2) the property received in the exchange or distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money,


* then no loss from the exchange or distribution shall be recognized.

#### (d) Securities as other property
* For purposes of this section—

* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term "other property" includes securities.

* #### (2) Exceptions
  * #### (A) Securities with respect to which nonrecognition of gain would be permitted
    * The term "other property" does not include securities to the extent that, under section 354 or 355, such securities would be permitted to be received without the recognition of gain.

  * #### (B) Greater principal amount in section 354 exchange
    * If—

      * (i) in an exchange described in section 354 (other than subsection (c) thereof), securities of a corporation a party to the reorganization are surrendered and securities of any corporation a party to the reorganization are received, and

      * (ii) the principal amount of such securities received exceeds the principal amount of such securities surrendered,


  * then, with respect to such securities received, the term "other property" means only the fair market value of such excess. For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C), if no securities are surrendered, the excess shall be the entire principal amount of the securities received.

  * #### (C) Greater principal amount in section 355 transaction
    * If, in an exchange or distribution described in section 355, the principal amount of the securities in the controlled corporation which are received exceeds the principal amount of the securities in the distributing corporation which are surrendered, then, with respect to such securities received, the term "other property" means only the fair market value of such excess.

#### (e) Nonqualified preferred stock treated as other property
* For purposes of this section—

* #### (1) In general
  * Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term "other property" includes nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(2)).

* #### (2) Exception
  * The term "other property" does not include nonqualified preferred stock (as so defined) to the extent that, under section 354 or 355, such preferred stock would be permitted to be received without the recognition of gain.

#### (f) Exchanges for section 306 stock
* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent that any of the other property (or money) is received in exchange for section 306 stock, an amount equal to the fair market value of such other property (or the amount of such money) shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.

#### (g) Transactions involving gift or compensation
  *  **For special rules for a transaction described in section 354, 355, or this section, but which—**

    * **(1) results in a gift, see section 2501 and following, or**

    * **(2) has the effect of the payment of compensation, see section 61(a)(1).**

### §357. Assumption of liability
#### (a) General rule
* Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if—

  * (1) the taxpayer receives property which would be permitted to be received under section 351 or 361 without the recognition of gain if it were the sole consideration, and

  * (2) as part of the consideration, another party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer,


* then such assumption shall not be treated as money or other property, and shall not prevent the exchange from being within the provisions of section 351 or 361, as the case may be.

#### (b) Tax avoidance purpose
* #### (1) In general
  * If, taking into consideration the nature of the liability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for the assumption was made, it appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to the assumption described in subsection (a)—

    * (A) was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or

    * (B) if not such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose,


* then such assumption (in the total amount of the liability assumed pursuant to such exchange) shall, for purposes of section 351 or 361 (as the case may be), be considered as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.

* #### (2) Burden of proof
  * In any suit or proceeding where the burden is on the taxpayer to prove such assumption is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer, such burden shall not be considered as sustained unless the taxpayer sustains such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence.

#### (c) Liabilities in excess of basis
* #### (1) In general
  * In the case of an exchange—

    * (A) to which section 351 applies, or

    * (B) to which section 361 applies by reason of a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355,


* if the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.

* #### (2) Exceptions
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any exchange—

    * (A) to which subsection (b)(1) of this section applies, or

    * (B) which is pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(G) where no former shareholder of the transferor corporation receives any consideration for his stock.

* #### (3) Certain liabilities excluded
  * #### (A) In general
    * If a taxpayer transfers, in an exchange to which section 351 applies, a liability the payment of which either—

      * (i) would give rise to a deduction, or

      * (ii) would be described in section 736(a),


  * then, for purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of such liability shall be excluded in determining the amount of liabilities assumed.

  * #### (B) Exception
    * Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any liability to the extent that the incurrence of the liability resulted in the creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any property.

#### (d) Determination of amount of liability assumed
* #### (1) In general
  * For purposes of this section, section 358(d), section 358(h), section 361(b)(3), section 362(d), section 368(a)(1)(C), and section 368(a)(2)(B), except as provided in regulations—

    * (A) a recourse liability (or portion thereof) shall be treated as having been assumed if, as determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances, the transferee has agreed to, and is expected to, satisfy such liability (or portion), whether or not the transferor has been relieved of such liability; and

    * (B) except to the extent provided in paragraph (2), a nonrecourse liability shall be treated as having been assumed by the transferee of any asset subject to such liability.

* #### (2) Exception for nonrecourse liability
  * The amount of the nonrecourse liability treated as described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by the lesser of—

    * (A) the amount of such liability which an owner of other assets not transferred to the transferee and also subject to such liability has agreed with the transferee to, and is expected to, satisfy; or

    * (B) the fair market value of such other assets (determined without regard to section 7701(g)).

* #### (3) Regulations
  * The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection and section 362(d). The Secretary may also prescribe regulations which provide that the manner in which a liability is treated as assumed under this subsection is applied, where appropriate, elsewhere in this title.

### §358. Basis to distributees
#### (a) General rule
* In the case of an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361 applies—

* #### (1) Nonrecognition property
  * The basis of the property permitted to be received under such section without the recognition of gain or loss shall be the same as that of the property exchanged—

    * (A) decreased by—

      * (i) the fair market value of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer,

      * (ii) the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and

      * (iii) the amount of loss to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange, and


    * (B) increased by—

      * (i) the amount which was treated as a dividend, and

      * (ii) the amount of gain to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange (not including any portion of such gain which was treated as a dividend).

* #### (2) Other property
  * The basis of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer shall be its fair market value.

#### (b) Allocation of basis
* #### (1) In general
  * Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the basis determined under subsection (a)(1) shall be allocated among the properties permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss.

* #### (2) Special rule for section 355
  * In the case of an exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, then in making the allocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall be taken into account not only the property so permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also the stock or securities (if any) of the distributing corporation which are retained, and the allocation of basis shall be made among all such properties.

#### (c) Section 355 transactions which are not exchanges
* For purposes of this section, a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies shall be treated as an exchange, and for such purposes the stock and securities of the distributing corporation which are retained shall be treated as surrendered, and received back, in the exchange.

#### (d) Assumption of liability
* #### (1) In general
  * Where, as part of the consideration to the taxpayer, another party to the exchange assumed a liability of the taxpayer, such assumption shall, for purposes of this section, be treated as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.

* #### (2) Exception
  * Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount of any liability excluded under section 357(c)(3).

#### (e) Exception
* This section shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the exchange of its stock or securities (or the stock or securities of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) as consideration in whole or in part for the transfer of the property to it.

#### (f) Definition of nonrecognition property in case of section 361 exchange
* For purposes of this section, the property permitted to be received under section 361 without the recognition of gain or loss shall be treated as consisting only of stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.

#### (g) Adjustments in intragroup transactions involving section 355
* In the case of a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies and which involves the distribution of stock from 1 member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to subsection (b) thereof) to another member of such group, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide adjustments to the adjusted basis of any stock which—

  * (1) is in a corporation which is a member of such group, and

  * (2) is held by another member of such group,


* to appropriately reflect the proper treatment of such distribution.

#### (h) Special rules for assumption of liabilities to which subsection (d) does not apply
* #### (1) In general
  * If, after application of the other provisions of this section to an exchange or series of exchanges, the basis of property to which subsection (a)(1) applies exceeds the fair market value of such property, then such basis shall be reduced (but not below such fair market value) by the amount (determined as of the date of the exchange) of any liability—

    * (A) which is assumed by another person as part of the exchange, and

    * (B) with respect to which subsection (d)(1) does not apply to the assumption.

* #### (2) Exceptions
  * Except as provided by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any liability if—

    * (A) the trade or business with which the liability is associated is transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange, or

    * (B) substantially all of the assets with which the liability is associated are transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange.

* #### (3) Liability
  * For purposes of this subsection, the term "liability" shall include any fixed or contingent obligation to make payment, without regard to whether the obligation is otherwise taken into account for purposes of this title.
