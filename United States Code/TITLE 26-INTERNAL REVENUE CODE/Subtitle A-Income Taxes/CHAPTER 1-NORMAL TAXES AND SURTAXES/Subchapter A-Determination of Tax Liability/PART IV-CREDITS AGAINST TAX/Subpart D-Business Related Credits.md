  * #### (D) Treatment of units occupied by individuals whose incomes rise above limit
    * #### (i) In general
      * Except as provided in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), notwithstanding an increase in the income of the occupants of a low-income unit above the income limitation applicable under paragraph (1), such unit shall continue to be treated as a low-income unit if the income of such occupants initially met such income limitation and such unit continues to be rent-restricted.

    * #### (ii) Rental of next available unit in case of 20–50 or 40–60 test
      * In the case of a project with respect to which the taxpayer elects the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), if the income of the occupants of the unit increases above 140 percent of the income limitation applicable under paragraph (1), clause (i) shall cease to apply to such unit if any residential rental unit in the building (of a size comparable to, or smaller than, such unit) is occupied by a new resident whose income exceeds such income limitation.

  * #### (E) Units where Federal rental assistance is reduced as tenant's income increases
    * If the gross rent with respect to a residential unit exceeds the limitation under subparagraph (A) by reason of the fact that the income of the occupants thereof exceeds the income limitation applicable under paragraph (1), such unit shall, nevertheless, be treated as a rent-restricted unit for purposes of paragraph (1) if—
