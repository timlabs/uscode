### SUBPART E—TREATMENT OF TRANSFERS TO RETIREE HEALTH ACCOUNTS

### §420. Transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts
#### (a) General rule
* If there is a qualified transfer of any excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, which is part of such plan—

  * (1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subsection (a) or (h) of section 401 solely by reason of such transfer (or any other action authorized under this section),

  * (2) no amount shall be includible in the gross income of the employer maintaining the plan solely by reason of such transfer,

  * (3) such transfer shall not be treated—

    * (A) as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980, or

    * (B) as a prohibited transaction for purposes of section 4975, and


  * (4) the limitations of subsection (d) shall apply to such employer.

#### (b) Qualified transfer
* For purposes of this section—

* #### (1) In general
  * The term "qualified transfer" means a transfer—

    * (A) of excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, which is part of such plan,

    * (B) which does not contravene any other provision of law, and

    * (C) with respect to which the following requirements are met in connection with the plan—

      * (i) the use requirements of subsection (c)(1),

      * (ii) the vesting requirements of subsection (c)(2), and

      * (iii) the minimum cost requirements of subsection (c)(3).

* #### (2) Only 1 transfer per year
  * No more than 1 transfer with respect to any plan during a taxable year may be treated as a qualified transfer for purposes of this section. If there is a transfer from a defined benefit plan to both a health benefits account and an applicable life insurance account during any taxable year, such transfers shall be treated as 1 transfer for purposes of this paragraph.

* #### (3) Limitation on amount transferred
  * The amount of excess pension assets which may be transferred to an account in a qualified transfer shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the taxable year of the transfer for qualified current retiree liabilities.

* #### (4) Expiration
  * No transfer made after December 31, 2025, shall be treated as a qualified transfer.

#### (c) Requirements of plans transferring assets
* #### (1) Use of transferred assets
  * #### (A) In general
    * Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay qualified current retiree liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under subsection (e)(1)(E)) for the taxable year of the transfer (whether directly or through reimbursement). In the case of a qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which subsection (f) applies, any assets so transferred may also be used to pay liabilities described in subsection (f)(2)(C).

  * #### (B) Amounts not used to pay for health benefits or life insurance
    * #### (i) In general
      * Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) which are not used as provided in subparagraph (A) shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan.

    * #### (ii) Tax treatment of amounts
      * Any amount transferred out of an account under clause (i)—

        * (I) shall not be includible in the gross income of the employer for such taxable year, but

        * (II) shall be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980 (without regard to subsection (d) thereof).

  * #### (C) Ordering rule
    * For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, shall be treated as paid first out of the assets and income described in subparagraph (A).

* #### (2) Requirements relating to pension benefits accruing before transfer
  * The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the transfer, immediately before such separation).

* #### (3) Minimum cost requirements
  * #### (A) In general
    * The requirements of this paragraph are met if each group health plan or arrangement under which applicable health benefits are provided, and each group-term life insurance plan under which applicable life insurance benefits are provided, provides that the applicable employer cost for each taxable year during the cost maintenance period shall not be less than the higher of the applicable employer costs for each of the 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the qualified transfer or, in the case of a transfer which involves a plan maintained by an employer described in subsection (f)(2)(E)(i)(III), if the plan meets the requirements of subsection (f)(2)(D)(i)(II).

  * #### (B) Applicable employer cost
    * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "applicable employer cost" means, with respect to any taxable year, the amount determined by dividing—

      * (i) the qualified current retiree liabilities of the employer for such taxable year determined—

        * (I) separately with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits,

        * (II) without regard to any reduction under subsection (e)(1)(B), and

        * (III) in the case of a taxable year in which there was no qualified transfer, in the same manner as if there had been such a transfer at the end of the taxable year, by


      * (ii) the number of individuals to whom coverage was provided during such taxable year for the benefits with respect to which the determination under clause (i) is made.

  * #### (C) Election to compute cost separately
    * An employer may elect to have this paragraph applied separately for applicable health benefits with respect to individuals eligible for benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals not so eligible, and separately for applicable life insurance benefits with respect to individuals age 65 or older at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals under age 65 during the taxable year.

  * #### (D) Cost maintenance period
    * For purposes of this paragraph, the term "cost maintenance period" means the period of 5 taxable years beginning with the taxable year in which the qualified transfer occurs. If a taxable year is in two or more overlapping cost maintenance periods, this paragraph shall be applied by taking into account the highest applicable employer cost required to be provided under subparagraph (A) for such taxable year.

  * #### (E) Regulations
    * #### (i) In general
      * The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent an employer who significantly reduces retiree health coverage or retiree life insurance coverage, as the case may be, during the cost maintenance period from being treated as satisfying the minimum cost requirement of this subsection.

    * #### (ii) Insignificant cost reductions for retiree health coverage permitted
      * #### (I) In general
        * An eligible employer shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if, in lieu of any reduction of retiree health coverage permitted under the regulations prescribed under clause (i), the employer reduces applicable employer cost by an amount not in excess of the reduction in costs which would have occurred if the employer had made the maximum permissible reduction in retiree health coverage under such regulations. In applying such regulations to any subsequent taxable year, any reduction in applicable employer cost under this clause shall be treated as if it were an equivalent reduction in retiree health coverage.

      * #### (II) Eligible employer
        * For purposes of subclause (I), an employer shall be treated as an eligible employer for any taxable year if, for the preceding taxable year, the qualified current retiree liabilities of the employer with respect to applicable health benefits were at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer. For purposes of this subclause, the rules of paragraphs (2), (3)(B), and (3)(C) of section 448(c) shall apply in determining the amount of an employer's gross receipts.

#### (d) Limitations on employer
* For purposes of this title—

* #### (1) Deduction limitations
  * No deduction shall be allowed—

    * (A) for the transfer of any amount to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (or any retransfer to the plan under subsection (c)(1)(B)),

    * (B) for qualified current retiree liabilities paid out of the assets (and income) described in subsection (c)(1), or

    * (C) for any amounts to which subparagraph (B) does not apply and which are paid for qualified current retiree liabilities for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are not greater than the excess (if any) of—

      * (i) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) (and income allocable thereto), over

      * (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B).

* #### (2) No contributions allowed
  * An employer may not contribute any amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to qualified current retiree liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1).

  * #### (C) Applicable health benefits
    * The term "applicable health benefits" means health benefits or coverage which are provided to—

  * For purposes of this subsection—

  * #### (A) In general
    * The terms "qualified future transfer" and "collectively bargained transfer" mean a transfer which meets all of the requirements for a qualified transfer, except that—

    * #### (ii) Requirement to maintain funded status
      * If, as of any valuation date of any plan year in the transfer period, the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(B) (after application of clause (i)) exceeds the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(A), either—

        * (I) the employer maintaining the plan shall make contributions to the plan in an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date, or

        * (II) there is transferred from the health benefits account or applicable life insurance account, as the case may be, to the plan an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date.

    * Notwithstanding subsection (b)(3), the amount of the excess pension assets which may be transferred—

      * (i) in the case of a qualified future transfer shall be equal to the sum of—

        * (I) if the transfer period includes the taxable year of the transfer, the amount determined under subsection (b)(3) for such taxable year, plus

        * (II) in the case of all other taxable years in the transfer period, the sum of the qualified current retiree liabilities which the plan reasonably estimates, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary, will be incurred for each of such years, and


      * (ii) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated, in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and generally accepted accounting principles, to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period for collectively bargained retiree liabilities.

  * #### (D) Minimum cost requirements
    * #### (i) In general
      * The requirements of subsection (c)(3) shall be treated as met if—

        * (II) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, each collectively bargained plan under which collectively bargained health benefits or collectively bargained life insurance benefits are provided provides that the collectively bargained employer cost for each taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period shall not be less than the amount specified by the collective bargaining agreement.

    * #### (ii) Election to maintain benefits for future transfers
      * An employer may elect, in lieu of the requirements of clause (i)(I), to meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3) with respect to applicable health benefits or applicable life insurance benefits by meeting the requirements of such subsection (as in effect before the amendments made by section 535 of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999) for each of the years described in the period under clause (i)(I). Such election may be made separately with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits. In the case of an election with respect to applicable life insurance benefits, the first sentence of this clause shall be applied as if subsection (c)(3) as in effect before the amendments made by such Act applied to such benefits.

    * #### (iii) Collectively bargained employer cost
      * For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "collectively bargained employer cost" means the average cost per covered individual of providing collectively bargained health benefits, collectively bargained life insurance benefits, or both, as the case may be, as determined in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Such agreement may provide for an appropriate reduction in the collectively bargained employer cost to take into account any portion of the collectively bargained health benefits, collectively bargained life insurance benefits, or both, as the case may be, that is provided or financed by a government program or other source.

  * #### (E) Special rules for collectively bargained transfers

        * (III) involves a defined benefit plan maintained by an employer which, in its taxable year ending in 2005, provided health benefits or coverage to retirees and their spouses and dependents under all of the health benefit plans maintained by the employer, but only if the aggregate cost (including administrative expenses) of such benefits or coverage which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer (if such benefits or coverage had been provided directly by the employer and the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) is at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer (determined in accordance with the last sentence of subsection (c)(3)(E)(ii)(II)) for such taxable year, or a plan maintained by a successor to such employer.

    * #### (ii) Use of assets
      * Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a collectively bargained transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay collectively bargained retiree liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under paragraph (6)(B)(iii)) for the taxable year of the transfer or for any subsequent taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period (whether directly or through reimbursement).

* #### (3) Coordination with other transfers
  * In applying subsection (b)(3) to any subsequent transfer during a taxable year in a transfer period or collectively bargained cost maintenance period, qualified current retiree liabilities shall be reduced by any such liabilities taken into account with respect to the qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which such period relates.

* #### (4) Special deduction rules for collectively bargained transfers
  * In the case of a collectively bargained transfer—

    * (A) the limitation under subsection (d)(1)(C) shall not apply, and

    * (B) notwithstanding subsection (d)(2), an employer may contribute an amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to collectively bargained retiree liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1)(B), and the deductibility of any such contribution shall be governed by the limits applicable to the deductibility of contributions to a welfare benefit fund under a collective bargaining agreement (as determined under section 419A(f)(5)(A)) without regard to whether such contributions are made to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund and without regard to the provisions of section 404 or the other provisions of this section.


* The Secretary shall provide rules to ensure that the application of this paragraph does not result in a deduction being allowed more than once for the same contribution or for 2 or more contributions or expenditures relating to the same collectively bargained retiree liabilities.

* #### (5) Transfer period
  * For purposes of this subsection, the term "transfer period" means, with respect to any transfer, a period of consecutive taxable years (not less than 2) specified in the election under paragraph (1) which begins and ends during the 10-taxable-year period beginning with the taxable year of the transfer.

    * #### (ii) Reduction for amounts previously set aside
      * The amount determined under clause (i) shall be reduced by the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the collectively bargained transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts, applicable life insurance accounts, or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the collectively bargained retiree liabilities. The preceding sentence shall be applied separately for collectively bargained health benefits and collectively bargained life insurance benefits.

    * #### (iii) Key employees excluded
      * If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)) with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing collectively bargained retiree liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating collectively bargained employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(C).

  * #### (B) Amounts transferred to plan on termination
    * Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified future transfer (and any income allocable thereto) which are not used as of the effective date of the election to terminate the transfer period with respect to such transfer under subparagraph (A), shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan within a reasonable period of time.
