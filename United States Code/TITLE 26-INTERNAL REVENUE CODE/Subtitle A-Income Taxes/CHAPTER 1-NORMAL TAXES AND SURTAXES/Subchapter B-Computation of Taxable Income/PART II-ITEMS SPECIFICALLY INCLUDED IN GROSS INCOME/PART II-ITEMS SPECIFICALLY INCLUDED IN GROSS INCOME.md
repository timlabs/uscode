#### (a) General rules for annuities
* #### (1) Income inclusion
  * Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, gross income includes any amount received as an annuity (whether for a period certain or during one or more lives) under an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract.

* #### (2) Partial annuitization
  * If any amount is received as an annuity for a period of 10 years or more or during one or more lives under any portion of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract—

    * (A) such portion shall be treated as a separate contract for purposes of this section,

    * (B) for purposes of applying subsections (b), (c), and (e), the investment in the contract shall be allocated pro rata between each portion of the contract from which amounts are received as an annuity and the portion of the contract from which amounts are not received as an annuity, and

    * (C) a separate annuity starting date under subsection (c)(4) shall be determined with respect to each portion of the contract from which amounts are received as an annuity.

#### (b) Exclusion ratio
* #### (1) In general
  * Gross income does not include that part of any amount received as an annuity under an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract which bears the same ratio to such amount as the investment in the contract (as of the annuity starting date) bears to the expected return under the contract (as of such date).

* #### (2) Exclusion limited to investment
  * The portion of any amount received as an annuity which is excluded from gross income under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the unrecovered investment in the contract immediately before the receipt of such amount.

* #### (3) Deduction where annuity payments cease before entire investment recovered
  * #### (A) In general
    * If—

      * (i) after the annuity starting date, payments as an annuity under the contract cease by reason of the death of an annuitant, and

      * (ii) as of the date of such cessation, there is unrecovered investment in the contract,


  * the amount of such unrecovered investment (in excess of any amount specified in subsection (e)(5) which was not included in gross income) shall be allowed as a deduction to the annuitant for his last taxable year.

  * #### (B) Payments to other persons
    * In the case of any contract which provides for payments meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (c)(2), the deduction under subparagraph (A) shall be allowed to the person entitled to such payments for the taxable year in which such payments are received.

  * #### (C) Net operating loss deductions provided
    * For purposes of section 172, a deduction allowed under this paragraph shall be treated as if it were attributable to a trade or business of the taxpayer.

* #### (4) Unrecovered investment
  * For purposes of this subsection, the unrecovered investment in the contract as of any date is—

    * (A) the investment in the contract (determined without regard to subsection (c)(2)) as of the annuity starting date, reduced by

    * (B) the aggregate amount received under the contract on or after such annuity starting date and before the date as of which the determination is being made, to the extent such amount was excludable from gross income under this subtitle.

#### (c) Definitions
* #### (1) Investment in the contract
  * For purposes of subsection (b), the investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date is—

    * (A) the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract, minus

    * (B) the aggregate amount received under the contract before such date, to the extent that such amount was excludable from gross income under this subtitle or prior income tax laws.

* #### (2) Adjustment in investment where there is refund feature
  * If—

    * (A) the expected return under the contract depends in whole or in part on the life expectancy of one or more individuals;

    * (B) the contract provides for payments to be made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of an annuitant) on or after the death of the annuitant or annuitants; and

    * (C) such payments are in the nature of a refund of the consideration paid,


* then the value (computed without discount for interest) of such payments on the annuity starting date shall be subtracted from the amount determined under paragraph (1). Such value shall be computed in accordance with actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary. For purposes of this paragraph and of subsection (e)(2)(A), the term "refund of the consideration paid" includes amounts payable after the death of an annuitant by reason of a provision in the contract for a life annuity with minimum period of payments certain, but (if part of the consideration was contributed by an employer) does not include that part of any payment to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the annuitant) which is not attributable to the consideration paid by the employee for the contract as determined under paragraph (1)(A).

* #### (3) Expected return
  * For purposes of subsection (b), the expected return under the contract shall be determined as follows:

  * #### (A) Life expectancy
    * If the expected return under the contract, for the period on and after the annuity starting date, depends in whole or in part on the life expectancy of one or more individuals, the expected return shall be computed with reference to actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary.

  * #### (B) Installment payments
    * If subparagraph (A) does not apply, the expected return is the aggregate of the amounts receivable under the contract as an annuity.

* #### (4) Annuity starting date
  * For purposes of this section, the annuity starting date in the case of any contract is the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity under the contract.
