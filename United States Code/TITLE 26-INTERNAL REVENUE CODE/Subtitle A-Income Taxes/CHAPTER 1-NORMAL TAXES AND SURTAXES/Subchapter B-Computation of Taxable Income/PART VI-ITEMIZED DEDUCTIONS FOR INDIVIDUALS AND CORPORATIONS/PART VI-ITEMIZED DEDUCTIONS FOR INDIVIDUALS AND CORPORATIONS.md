      * (ii) the property is not transferred by the donee in exchange for money, other property, or services;

      * (iii) the taxpayer receives from the donee a written statement representing that its use and disposition of the property will be in accordance with the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii); and

    * #### (iii) Rules related to limitation
      * #### (I) Carryover

For purposes of this subparagraph, a contribution by a taxpayer of the right to use property shall be treated as a contribution of less than the taxpayer's entire interest in such property.

  * #### (B) Exceptions
    * Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to—

      * (i) a contribution of a remainder interest in a personal residence or farm,

* #### (2) Tax-exempt bonds
  * In the case of any bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income, no deduction shall be allowed for the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year.

* #### (1) Amount of bond premium
  * For purposes of paragraph (2), the amount of bond premium, in the case of the holder of any bond, shall be determined—

    * (A) with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond,

    * (B)(i) with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium attributable to the period before the call date, with reference to the amount payable on the earlier call date), in the case of a bond described in subsection (a)(1), and

    * (ii) with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on an earlier call date, in the case of a bond described in subsection (a)(2).

    * (C) with adjustments proper to reflect unamortized bond premium, with respect to the bond, for the period before the date as of which subsection (a) becomes applicable with respect to the taxpayer with respect to such bond.


* In no case shall the amount of bond premium on a convertible bond include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.

* #### (2) Amount amortizable
  * The amortizable bond premium of the taxable year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such year.

* #### (3) Method of determination
  * #### (A) In general
    * Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the determinations required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made on the basis of the taxpayer's yield to maturity determined by—

    * For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the amount payable on an earlier call date is used under paragraph (1)(B)(i) in determining the amortizable bond premium attributable to the period before the earlier call date, such bond shall be treated as maturing on such date for the amount so payable and then reissued on such date for the amount so payable.

* #### (4) Treatment of certain bonds acquired in exchange for other property
  * #### (A) In general
    * If—

      * (i) a bond is acquired by any person in exchange for other property, and

      * (ii) the basis of such bond is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such other property,


  * for purposes of applying this subsection to such bond while held by such person, the basis of such bond shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the exchange.

  * #### (B) Special rule where bond exchanged in reorganization
    * Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an exchange by the taxpayer of a bond for another bond if such exchange is a part of a reorganization (as defined in section 368).

#### (c) Election as to taxable bonds

If such election is made with respect to any bond (described in paragraph (1)) of the taxpayer, it shall also apply to all such bonds held by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by him and shall be binding for all subsequent taxable years with respect to all such bonds of the taxpayer, unless, on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary permits him, subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to revoke such election. In the case of bonds held by a common trust fund, as defined in section 584(a), the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the common trust fund. In case of bonds held by an estate or trust, the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the fiduciary.

#### (d) Bond defined
* For purposes of this section, the term "bond" means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, but does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or any such obligation held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.

#### (e) Treatment as offset to interest payments
* Except as provided in regulations, in the case of any taxable bond—

        * (II) the amount of the net operating loss for such taxable year.

    * #### (iii) Coordination with paragraph (2)
