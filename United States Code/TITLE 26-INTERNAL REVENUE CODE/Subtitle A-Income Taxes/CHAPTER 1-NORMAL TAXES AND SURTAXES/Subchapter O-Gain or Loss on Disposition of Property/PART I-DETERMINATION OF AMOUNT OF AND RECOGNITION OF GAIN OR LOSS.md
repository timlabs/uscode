### §1001. Determination of amount of and recognition of gain or loss
#### (a) Computation of gain or loss

* Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under this section, on the sale or exchange of property shall be recognized.

#### (d) Installment sales

#### (e) Certain term interests
* #### (1) In general
  * In determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of a term interest in property, that portion of the adjusted basis of such interest which is determined pursuant to section 1014, 1015, or 1041 (to the extent that such adjusted basis is a portion of the entire adjusted basis of the property) shall be disregarded.

* #### (2) Term interest in property defined
  * For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "term interest in property" means—

    * (A) a life interest in property,
