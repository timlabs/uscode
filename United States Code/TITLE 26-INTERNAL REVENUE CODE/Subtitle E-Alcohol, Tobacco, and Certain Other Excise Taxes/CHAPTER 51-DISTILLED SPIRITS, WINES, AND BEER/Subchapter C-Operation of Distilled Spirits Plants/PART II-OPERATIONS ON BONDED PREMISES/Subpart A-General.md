### §5211. Production and entry of distilled spirits
* Distilled spirits in the process of production in a distilled spirits plant may be held prior to the production gauge only for so long as is reasonably necessary to complete the process of production. Under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, all distilled spirits produced in a distilled spirits plant shall be gauged and a record made of such gauge within a reasonable time after the production thereof has been completed. The proprietor shall, pursuant to such production gauge and in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, make appropriate entry for—

  * (1) deposit of such spirits on bonded premises for storage or processing;

  * (2) withdrawal upon determination of tax as authorized by law;

  * (3) withdrawal under the provisions of section 5214; and

### §5212. Transfer of distilled spirits between bonded premises
* Bulk distilled spirits on which the internal revenue tax has not been paid or determined as authorized by law may, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, be transferred in bond between bonded premises in any approved container.

The provisions of this section restricting transfers to bulk distilled spirits shall not apply to alcohol bottled under the provisions of section 5235 which is to be withdrawn for industrial purposes. In the case of distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, between bonded premises belonging to the same person or members of the same controlled group (within the meaning of section 5001(c)(2)) this section shall be applied without regard to whether distilled spirits are bulk distilled spirits. In the case of distilled spirits transferred in bond from the person who distilled or processed such distilled spirits (hereinafter referred to as "transferor") to another person for bottling or storage of such distilled spirits, and returned to the transferor for removal, this section shall be applied without regard to whether distilled spirits are bulk distilled spirits, but only if the transferor retains title during the entire period between such distillation, or processing, and removal.
