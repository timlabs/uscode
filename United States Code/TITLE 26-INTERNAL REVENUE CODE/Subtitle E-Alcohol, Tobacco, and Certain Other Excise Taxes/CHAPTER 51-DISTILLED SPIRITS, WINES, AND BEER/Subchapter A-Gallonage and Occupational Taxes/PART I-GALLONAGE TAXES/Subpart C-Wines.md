* #### (5) Credit for transferee in bond
  * If—

    * (A) wine produced by any person would be eligible for any credit under paragraph (1) if removed by such person during the calendar year,

    * (B) wine produced by such person is removed during such calendar year by any other person (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the "transferee") to whom such wine was transferred in bond and who is liable for the tax imposed by this section with respect to such wine, and

    * (C) such producer holds title to such wine at the time of its removal and provides to the transferee such information as is necessary to properly determine the transferee's credit under this paragraph,
