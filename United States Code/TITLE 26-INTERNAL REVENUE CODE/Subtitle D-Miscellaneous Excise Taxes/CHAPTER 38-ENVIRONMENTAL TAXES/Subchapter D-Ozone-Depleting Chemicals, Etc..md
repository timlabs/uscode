    * #### (ii) 1986 export percentage
      * A person's 1986 export percentage is the percentage equal to the ozone-depletion factor adjusted pounds of ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured or produced by such person during 1986 which were exported during 1986, divided by the ozone-depletion factor adjusted pounds of all ozone-depleting chemicals manufactured or produced by such person during 1986. The percentage determined under the preceding sentence shall be computed by taking into account the sum of such person's direct 1986 exports (as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency) and such person's indirect 1986 exports (as allocated to such person by such Agency in determining such person's consumption and production rights for ozone-depleting chemicals).
