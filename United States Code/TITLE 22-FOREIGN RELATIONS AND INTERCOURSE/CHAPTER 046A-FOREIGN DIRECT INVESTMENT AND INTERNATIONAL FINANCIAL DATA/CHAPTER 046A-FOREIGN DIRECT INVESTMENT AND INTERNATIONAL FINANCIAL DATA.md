### **CHAPTER 46A—FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL DATA**

### §3141. Congressional findings
* The Congress makes the following findings:

  * (1) The United States Government collects substantial amounts of information from foreign owned or controlled business enterprises or affiliates operating in the United States.

  * (2) Additional analysis and presentation of this information is desirable to assist the public debate on the issue of foreign direct investments in the United States.

  * (3) Information collected from foreign owned or controlled firms by the Bureau of Economic Analysis has serious analytical limitations because it is largely collected on an "enterprise" basis that does not permit an adequate analysis by industry groupings.

  * (4) Statistical and analytic comparisons of the performance of foreign owned or controlled businesses operating within the United States with other business enterprises operating within the same industry can be accomplished under sections 3101(b) and 3104(c) of this title, and under Executive Order Numbered 11961, without the need to collect additional information, by sharing with other authorized Government agencies the employer identification numbers maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

  * (5) Public disclosures of confidential business information collected by the United States Government relating to international direct investment flows could cause serious damage to the accuracy of the statistical data base.

  * (6) The Government Accountability Office may have limited access to Government data on foreign direct investment.

### §3142. Report by Secretary of Commerce
#### (a) Annual report on foreign direct investment in United States
* Not later than 6 months after November 7, 1990, and not later than the end of each 1-year period occurring thereafter, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and to the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress a report on the role and significance of foreign direct investment in the United States. Such report shall address the history, scope, trends, market concentrations, and effects on the United States economy of such investment. In addition, the Secretary of Commerce shall, if requested by any such committee, appear before that committee to provide testimony with respect to any report under this subsection.

#### (b) Sources of data
* In preparing each report under subsection (a), the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary's designees, shall consider information collected by—

#### (c) Analyses
* (1) The analysis in each report prepared under subsection (a) shall, to the extent of available data, compare business enterprises controlled by foreign persons with other business enterprises in the United States with respect to employment, market share, value added, productivity, research and development, exports, imports, profitability, taxes paid, and investment incentives and services provided by State and local governments (including quasi-governmental entities).

* (2) Each such analysis shall be done by significant industry sectors and geographical regions, except that information shall not be presented in a way in which any person, including any business enterprise or establishment, can be identified. The restriction contained in the preceding sentence on presentation of information does not apply to information that is obtained from foreign governments or agencies thereof and that has been published pursuant to the lawful disclosure of the information.
