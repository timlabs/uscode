    * (C) provide that letters of intent submitted to the Fund in support of an economic adjustment program reflect that the member country has taken into account the effect such program will have on the factors listed in subparagraph (B);

### §286aa. Instructions to United States Executive Director; Communist dictatorships
* The Congress hereby finds that Communist dictatorships result in severe constraints on labor and capital mobility and other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities which contribute to balance of payments deficits in direct contradiction of the goals of the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to actively oppose any facility involving use of Fund credit by any Communist dictatorship, unless the Secretary of the Treasury certifies and documents in writing upon request and so notifies and appears, if requested, before the Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committees of the Senate and the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on such drawing that such drawing—

  * (1) provides the basis for correcting the balance of payments difficulties and restoring a sustainable balance of payments position;

  * (2) would reduce the severe constraints on labor and capital mobility or other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities and advances market-oriented forces in that country; and

  * (3) is in the best economic interest of the majority of the people in that country.


* Should the Secretary not meet a request to appear before the aforementioned committees at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on any facility involving use of Fund credit by any communist dictatorship and certify and document in writing that these three conditions have been met, the United States Executive Director shall vote against such program.

    * (A) the economic adjustment program converts high interest rate, short-term bank debt into long-term debt at significantly narrower interest rate spreads than the average interest rate spreads prevailing on bank debt reschedulings negotiated between August 1982 and August 1983 for countries receiving assistance from the Fund for economic adjustment programs in order to minimize the burdens of adjustment on the debtor nation, provided that such interest rate spreads are consistent with that nation's need to obtain adequate external private financing;

    * (B) the annual external debt service required of the country involved is a manageable and prudent percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and

    * (C) the economic adjustment program will not have an adverse impact on international economic growth, world trade, exports, and employment of other member countries, and the long-term solvency of banks.
