### §262_l_–2. Sustainable use of natural resources; use of agricultural and industrial chemicals
#### (a) Instructions to Executive Directors of Multilateral Development Banks
* It is the policy of the United States that sustainable economic growth must be predicated on sustainable use of natural resources. The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDB's) to—

  * (1) promote the adoption of internal guidelines requiring the use of least-cost planning techniques in evaluating proposed energy loans, and consider refusal to support power generation, utilization or energy sector loans unless cost-effective conservation measures have been fully evaluated and considered;

  * (2) encourage each MDB to offer technical assistance to borrower nations in preparing national energy plans. Special emphasis shall be given to least-cost analysis in making decisions on energy use and development, and such analyses shall take into account all demand-side as well as supply-side options;

  * (3) promote expansion of MDB expertise in the areas of energy conservation and renewable energy sources;

  * (4) promote the adoption of lending strategies which place increased emphasis on energy conservation and efficiency as opposed to merely increasing generating capacity;

  * (5) promote adoption of policies which minimize emissions of greenhouse gases;

  * (6) promote the adoption of lending strategies that place increased emphasis on energy efficient transportation programs. Such strategies shall consider alternatives to conventional mechanized transport such as nonmotorized vehicles, public transport and increased energy and cost efficiency of transportation systems; and

  * (7) promote the use of existing and the development of new mechanisms to promote conservation of biological diversity. Existing resources to be consulted shall include but not be limited to Conservation Data Centers.

#### (b) Bilateral and multilateral discussions to strengthen environmental performance of Multilateral Development Banks
* The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, shall conduct bilateral and multilateral discussions with other members of the MDB's to further strengthen the environmental performance of each bank. These discussions shall include, but not be limited to organizational, administrative and procedural arrangements to remove impediments to the efficient and effective management of assistance programs necessary to protect and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources and to carry out such assistance programs in consultation with affected local communities.

#### (c) Duties of Administrator of Agency for International Development
* The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall—

  * (1) in the submission of future "early warning system" reports, as required by the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1988, make use of resources that promote the conservation of biological diversity, such as Conservation Data Centers;

  * (2) submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, by January 15, 1989, on the Agency's activities and practices which encourage or discourage the use of renewable energy technologies overseas, and on ways to correct or refocus those efforts. This report shall include but is not limited to Agency activities which could be directed to develop a stronger interface with the private sector through the establishment of a United States Renewable Energy Industry Advisory Council;

  * (3) issue guidance to all Agency missions stating that renewable energy resources and conservation are to be the centerpiece of its energy efforts, and meeting energy needs through these means shall be discussed in every Country Development Strategy Statement; and

  * (4) take steps to implement recommendations set forth by a report of the Committee on Health and Environment on opportunities for the Agency to assist developing countries in the proper use of agricultural and industrial chemicals.
