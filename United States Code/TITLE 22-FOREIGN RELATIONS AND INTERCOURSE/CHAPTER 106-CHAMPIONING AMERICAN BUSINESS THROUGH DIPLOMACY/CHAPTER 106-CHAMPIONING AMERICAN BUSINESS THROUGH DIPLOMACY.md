### **CHAPTER 106—CHAMPIONING AMERICAN BUSINESS THROUGH DIPLOMACY**

### §9901. Findings
* Congress makes the following findings:

A transparent and level playing field for U.S. investment in these countries counters real and growing challenges such as China's Belt and Road initiative.".

  * (3) In the January–February 2019 issue of The Foreign Service Journal, Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, the President of the American Foreign Service Association, wrote, "Foreign Service support for American business.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.is a major reason why the U.S. Foreign Service was created.".
