### **CHAPTER 25—PROTECTION OF VESSELS ON THE HIGH SEAS AND IN TERRITORIAL WATERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES**

### §1971. "Vessel of the United States" defined
* For the purposes of this chapter the term "vessel of the United States" shall mean any private vessel documented or certificated under the laws of the United States. Notwithstanding any other law, the documentation or certification of any such vessel shall not be considered to be affected, for the purposes of this chapter, in any manner or to any extent if at any time during any voyage for the purpose of fishing beyond the fishery conservation zone (as defined in section 1802(8) of title 16), the vessel is commanded by other than a citizen of the United States.

### §1972. Action by Secretary of State upon seizure of vessel by foreign country; preconditions
* If—

  * (1) any vessel of the United States is seized by a foreign country on the basis of claims to jurisdiction that are not recognized by the United States, or on the basis of claims to jurisdiction recognized by the United States but exercised in a manner inconsistent with international law as recognized by the United States;

  * (2) any general claim of any foreign country to exclusive fishery management authority is recognized by the United States, and any vessel of the United States is seized by such foreign country on the basis of conditions and restrictions under such claim, if such conditions and restrictions—

    * (A) are unrelated to fishery conservation and management,

    * (B) fail to consider and take into account traditional fishing practices of vessels of the United States,

    * (C) are greater or more onerous than the conditions and restrictions which the United States applies to foreign fishing vessels subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States (as established in title I of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act [16 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.]), or

    * (D) fail to allow fishing vessels of the United States equitable access to fish subject to such country's exclusive fishery management authority;


* the Secretary of State, unless there is clear and convincing credible evidence that the seizure did not meet the requirements under paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, shall immediately take such steps as are necessary—

  * (i) for the protection of such vessel and for the health and welfare of its crew;

  * (ii) to secure the release of such vessel and its crew; and

  * (iii) to determine the amount of any fine, license, fee, registration fee, or other direct charge reimbursable under section 1973(a) of this title.

### §1973. Reimbursement of owner for any direct charges paid to secure release of vessel and crew
#### (a) Reimbursement by Secretary of State; "other direct charge" defined; source of reimbursement
* In any case where a vessel of the United States is seized by a foreign country under the conditions of section 1972 of this title and a fine, license fee, registration fee, or any other direct charge must be paid in order to secure the prompt release of the vessel and crew, the owners of the vessel shall be reimbursed by the Secretary of State in the amount determined and certified by him as being the amount of the fine, license fee, registration fee, or any other direct charge actually paid. For purposes of this section, the term "other direct charge" means any levy, however characterized or computed (including, but not limited to, any computation based on the value of a vessel or the value of fish or other property on board a vessel), which is imposed in addition to any fine, license fee, or registration fee. Any reimbursement under this section shall be made from the Fishermen's Protective Fund established pursuant to section 1979 of this title.

#### (b) Determination and certification of charges by Secretary of State; reimbursement as lien on vessel; termination of lien
* The Secretary of State shall make a determination and certification under subsection (a) of this section as soon as possible after he is notified pursuant to section 1972(b) of this title of the amounts of the fines, fees, and other direct charges which were paid by the owners to secure the release of their vessel and crew. The amount of reimbursement made by the Secretary of State to the owners of any vessel under subsection (a) of this section shall constitute a lien on the vessel which may be recovered in proceedings by libel in rem in the district court of the United States for any district within which the vessel may be. Any such lien shall terminate on the ninetieth day after the date on which the Secretary of State reimburses the owners under this section unless before such ninetieth day the United States initiates action to enforce the lien.

### §1974. Inapplicability of chapter to certain seizures
* The provisions of this chapter shall not apply with respect to a seizure made by a country at war with the United States or a seizure made in accordance with the provisions of any applicable convention or treaty, if that treaty or convention was made with advice and consent to the Senate and was in force and effect for the United States and the seizing country at the time of the seizure.

### §1975. Claims for amounts expended because of seizure
#### (a) Action by Secretary
* The Secretary of State shall—

  * (1) immediately notify a foreign country of—

    * (A) any reimbursement made by him under section 1973 of this title as a result of the seizure of a vessel of the United States by such country,

    * (B) any payment made pursuant to section 1977 of this title in connection with such seizure, and


  * (2) take such action as he deems appropriate to make and collect claims against such foreign country for the amounts so reimbursed and payments so made.

#### (b) Withholding amount of unpaid claim from foreign assistance funds
* If a foreign country fails or refuses to make payment in full on any claim made under subsection (a)(2) of this section within one hundred and twenty days after the date on which such country is notified pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of State shall transfer an amount equal to such unpaid claim or unpaid portion thereof from any funds appropriated by Congress and programed for the current fiscal year for assistance to the government of such country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.] unless the President certifies to the Congress that it is in the national interest not to do so in the particular instance (and if such funds are insufficient to cover such claim, transfer shall be made from any funds so appropriated and programed for the next and any succeeding fiscal year) to (1) the Fishermen's Protective Fund established pursuant to section 1979 of this title if the amount is transferred with respect to an unpaid claim for a reimbursement made under section 1973 of this title, or (2) the separate account established in the Treasury of the United States pursuant to section 1977(c) of this title if the amount is transferred with respect to an unpaid claim for a payment made under section 1977(a) of this title. Amounts transferred under this section shall not constitute satisfaction of any such claim of the United States against such foreign country.

### §1976. Authorization of appropriations
* There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

### §1977. Reimbursement for seized commercial fishermen
#### (a) Agreement to reimburse for actual costs, confiscation or spoilage of fish, and loss of income

Such agreement shall provide that, if said vessel is seized by a foreign country and detained under the conditions of section 1972 of this title, the Secretary shall guarantee—

  * (1) the owner of such vessel for all actual costs, except those covered by section 1973 of this title, incurred by the owner during the seizure and detention period and as a direct result thereof, as determined by the Secretary, resulting (A) from any damage to, or destruction of, such vessel, or its fishing gear or other equipment, (B) from the loss or confiscation of such vessel, gear, or equipment, or (C) from dockage fees or utilities;

  * (2) the owner of such vessel and its crew for the market value of fish caught before seizure of such vessel and confiscated or spoiled during the period of detention; and

  * (3) the owner of such vessel and its crew for not to exceed 50 per centum of the gross income lost as a direct result of such seizure and detention, as determined by the Secretary of State, based on the value of the average catch per day's fishing during the three most recent calendar years immediately preceding such seizure and detention of the vessel seized, or, if such experience is not available, then of all commercial fishing vessels of the United States engaged in the same fishery as that of the type and size of the seized vessel.

#### (b) Distribution of payments according to commercial fishing practices and procedures
* Payments made by the Secretary under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of this section shall be distributed by the Secretary in accordance with the usual practices and procedures of the particular segment of the United States commercial fishing industry to which the seized vessel belongs relative to the sale of fish caught and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale.

#### (c) Establishment of fees; amount of fees; credit of fees to separate Treasury account; payment from collected fees; authorization of appropriations
* The Secretary shall from time to time establish by regulation fees which shall be paid by the owners of vessels entering into agreements under this section.

All fees collected by the Secretary shall be credited to a separate account established in the Treasury of the United States which shall remain available without fiscal year limitation to carry out the provisions of this section. Those fees not currently needed for payments under this section shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States and all revenues accruing from such deposits or investments shall be credited to such separate account. If a transfer of funds is made to the separate account under section 1975(b)(2) of this title with respect to an unpaid claim and such claim is later paid, the amount so paid shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. All payments under this section shall be made first out of such fees so long as they are available and thereafter out of funds which are hereby authorized to be appropriated to such account to carry out the provisions of this section.

#### (d) Finality of determinations; insured losses

#### (b) Causes of loss or destruction
* Subject to the provisions of this section, the owner or operator (hereinafter referred to as the "vessel owner") of any fishing vessel which is a vessel of the United States is eligible for monetary compensation under this section for any damage to, loss of, or destruction of such vessel, or any fishing gear used with such vessel, or both, and for any resulting economic loss, if the damage, loss, or destruction—

  * (1) in the case of such vessel—

If petition for review is not made to the Secretary within such thirty-day period regarding the initial determination, the initial determination shall be deemed to be the final determination on the application. Before undertaking any such review, the Secretary shall provide to the vessel owner opportunity to submit additional written or oral evidence relating to the decision. After review the Secretary shall issue a final determination with respect to the application.

* (3) Whenever the amount in the fund is not sufficient to pay compensation under this section, the Secretary may issue, in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000, notes or other obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. Such notices or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of such notices or other obligations.
