### §702. Arrest of offenders
* Upon a specific or general request of the officer commanding any friendly foreign force, having service courts of appropriate jurisdiction within the United States, it shall be lawful for any person in the civil, military, or naval establishments of the United States having authority to arrest, summarily to arrest any member of such force designated in such request and to deliver him to the custody of any officer of such force or to the custody of the military or naval authorities of the United States who shall deliver him forthwith to the custody of an officer of such force, for trial in such service courts within the United States for such offenses as shall lie within the jurisdiction of the service courts of such friendly foreign force: _Provided_, That the trial of any member of such friendly foreign force for an offense against a member of the civilian population shall be in open court (except where security consideration forbids), shall take place promptly in the United States and within a reasonable distance from the place where the offense is alleged to have been committed, for the convenience of witnesses.

### §703. Attendance of witnesses
#### (a) Subpoena; contempt; fees
* Any district court of the United States, or the United States courts of any Territory or possession, within the jurisdiction of which proceedings are had before any service court of a friendly foreign force, or within the jurisdiction of which any person is found, shall have jurisdiction, upon application made by a service court of a friendly foreign force, to issue to such person an order requiring him to appear before the service court or an officer designated to take a deposition for use before such service court and there to produce evidence or give testimony if so ordered. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof: _Provided_, That the fees of such witnesses and the mileage at the rate allowed to witnesses attending the courts of the United States should be duly paid or tendered in advance to such witnesses, with funds to be supplied by the friendly foreign force. Except as expressly permitted by the court, in its discretion, no such order shall run into any other district.

### §704. Immunities of courts and witnesses
