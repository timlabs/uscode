  * (1) acquiring for any source and providing (by loan or grant) any defense article or defense service;

  * (2) assigning or detailing members of the Armed Forces of the United States and other personnel of the Department of Defense to perform duties of a noncombatant nature; or

  * (3) transferring such of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this part as the President may determine for assistance to a recipient country, to the account in which funds for the procurement of defense articles and defense services under section 21 and section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2761 and 2762] have been deposited for such recipient, to be merged with such deposited funds, and to be used solely to meet obligations of the recipient for payment for sales under that Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].


* Sales which are wholly paid from funds transferred under paragraph (3) or from funds made available on a non-repayable basis under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2763] shall be priced to exclude the costs of salaries of members of the Armed Forces of the United States (other than the Coast Guard).

#### (b) Terms and conditions
* In addition to such other terms and conditions as the President may determine pursuant to subsection (a), defense articles may be loaned thereunder only if—

  * (1) there is a bona fide reason, other than the shortage of funds, for providing such articles on a loan basis rather than on a grant basis;

  * (2) there is a reasonable expectation that such articles will be returned to the agency making the loan at the end of the loan period, unless the loan is then renewed;

  * (3) the loan period is of fixed duration not exceeding five years, during which such article may be recalled for any reason by the United States;

  * (4) the agency making the loan is reimbursed for the loan based on the amount charged to the appropriation for military assistance under subsection (c); and

#### (c) Appropriation charges; exceptions
* (1) In the case of any loan of a defense article or defense service made under this section, there shall be a charge to the appropriation for military assistance for any fiscal year while the article or service is on loan in an amount based on—

  * (B) the depreciation which occurs during such year while such article is on loan.

* (2) Amounts appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.

#### (b) Programing and budgeting procedures
* In order to make sure that a dollar spent on military assistance to foreign countries is as necessary as a dollar spent for the United States military establishment, the President shall establish procedures for programing and budgeting so that programs of military assistance come into direct competition for financial support with other activities and programs of the Department of Defense.

### §2314. Furnishing of defense articles or related training or other defense service on grant basis

    * (B) transfer, or permit any officer, employee, or agent of that country to transfer such articles or related training or other defense service by gift, sale, or otherwise, or

    * (C) use or permit the use of such articles or related training or other defense service for purposes other than those for which furnished;

  * (3) that such country is taking all reasonable measures, consistent with its political and economic stability, which may be needed to develop its defense capacities; and

  * (4) that the increased ability of such country to defend itself is important to the security of the United States.

* The President shall regularly reduce and, with such deliberate speed as orderly procedure and other relevant considerations, including prior commitments, will permit, shall terminate all further grants of military equipment and supplies to any country having sufficient wealth to enable it, in the judgment of the President, to maintain and equip its own military forces at adequate strength, without undue burden to its economy.

#### (d) Termination of assistance; report of violation by President; conditions for reinstatement
* (1) Assistance and deliveries of assistance under this part to any country shall be terminated as hereinafter provided, if such country uses defense articles or defense services furnished under this chapter, the Mutual Security Act of 1954, or any predecessor Foreign Assistance Act, in substantial violation (either in terms of quantities or in terms of the gravity of the consequences regardless of the quantities involved) of any agreement entered into pursuant to any such Act (A) by using such articles or services for a purpose not authorized under section 2302 of this title or, if such agreement provides that such articles or services may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 2302 of this title, for a purpose not authorized under such agreement; (B) by transferring such articles or services to, or permitting any use of such articles or services by, anyone not an officer, employee, or agent of the recipient country without the consent of the President; or (C) by failing to maintain the security of such articles or services.

* In considering a request for approval of any transfer of any weapon, weapons system, munitions, aircraft, military boat, military vessel, or other implement of war to another country, the President shall not give his consent under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4) to the transfer unless the United States itself would transfer the defense article under consideration to that country. In addition, the President shall not give his consent under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4) to the transfer of any significant defense articles on the United States Munitions List unless the foreign country requesting consent to transfer agrees to demilitarize such defense articles prior to transfer, or the proposed recipient foreign country provides a commitment in writing to the United States Government that it will not transfer such defense articles, if not demilitarized, to any other foreign country or person without first obtaining the consent of the President.

#### (f) Disposition of defense articles furnished on a grant basis; net proceeds to be paid over to the United States
